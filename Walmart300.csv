"Just what kind of people does your company hire that allows a pharmacy tech, SARAH BRAND to publicly humiliate and degrade the sick and those on medicaid?? By now you are well aware of her disgusting video, where she feels its perfectly acceptable to degrade people like myself who DEPEND on pain medication for a QUALITY OF LIFE! She even posts to her facebook page how her boss is perfectly fine with it and finds it quite entertaining..REALLY!!!! YOU ALL NEED A HUGE WAKE UP CALLING! NONE OF YOU HAVE ANY CLUE WHAT ITS LIKE TO HAVE YOUR BODY RIPPED APART BY SEVERE PAIN EVERY DAY AND NIGHT, THAT CAUSES YOU TO VOMIT UNCONTROLLABLY, BUT YET YOU FEEL ITS RATHER ENTERTAINING TO PUT DOWN YOUR CUSTOMERS THAT EXIST IN SEVERE NEVER ENDING PAIN AND DEPEND ON OPIODS FOR A QUALITY OF LIFE, TO DEGRADE THEM PUBLICLY!?!?! ALL OVER THE INTERNET?!?!?  TO DEGRADE THEM FOR HAVING TO RELY ON LIFE SAVING MEDICATIONS THAT HAPPEN TO BE NARCOTICS OR FOR MENTAL ILLNESS!?!? SHAME ON YOU WALMART! SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED ON THE SPOT !! I HOPE YOU LOOSE  MANY CUSTOMERS OVER THIS UNACCEPTABLE AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR! MANY MANY PAIN SUFFERERS HAVE REPORTED HER TO THE ADA AND THE PHARMACY BOARD ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE PATHETIC PHARMACISTS ON THE FACEBOOK PAGE CALLED THE CYNICAL PHARMACIST, WHERE THEY CONTINUE TO PUBLICLY DEGRADE THE SICK. SCREENSHOTS ARE A WONDERFUL THING..I  HOPE ALL OF THEIR LICENSES ARE REVOKED AND THEY ARE TAUGHT A VALUABLE LESSON IN ETHICS, COMPASSION AND EMPATHY TOWARDS THE SICK!","2016-03-01T19:09:53+0000","147570341990082_988442054569569","Walmart300"
"It's a shame that you allow your employee's to speak about YOUR customers and there medication needs. We're the reason you all have paychecks! She or you have no idea what some of us go through on a daily basis with health issues. If it wasn't for such drugs as she so lightly speaks of some of us wouldn't be able to get outta bed everyday! She or this store apparently has no compassion for people with debilitating diseases that causes such severe pain that we struggle to take care of our young children and everyday chores that SHE takes for granted. I worked in health care for 15 yrs until it destroyed my back, I was great at what I did and didn't judge my pts for there illnesses! I'd give anything to work again so my husband and I are not struggling financially. I'd love to be able to  run and fly a kite with my 8 yr old, or skate or play hide and seek with my child!!!!! This is people's lives she speaks of with stories, but she doesn't care because it's not her and she chooses to see only the outside that looks ok but she can't see the inside that's riddled with pain that keeps us awake for days at a time WITH meds. So before you make a ""song"", about narcotics try to use some of your brain to consider why most of these people are taking them!!!!!!!!","2016-03-01T18:28:11+0000","147570341990082_988426224571152","Walmart300"
"I certainly hope that something has been done for this situation other than the repeated and bland appreciation for bringing this to your attention and providing a link. I have complex health issues and I have almost $3000 worth of prescription medications a MONTH alone that I do at your store. Thankfully my insurance pays for a great majority of it. However my insurance works just about everywhere! So if these are the types of employees you continue to support and not fire on the spot. Then I will bring my $3000 prescription meds business as well as my everyday shopping business to another company in which respects ALL of their customers. Not just the politically correct customers! Each and every patient that comes to your pharmacy has a story! And just because their story may not be acceptable to poor Ms Sarah Brand does not mean she gets to write a humiliating discriminatory song about it and post it all over the internet (including the one that is STILL on her facebook page BTW. This is how I know she has not been rightfully dealt with) and then boast make fun of and talk down to anyone who expressed their feelings over it. Write a song all you want. But keep it private! Although I think in this case it is actually better. Because an snooty judgmental self righteous person who is responsible for LIFE SAVING medications for 1000s of patients has been exposed. And her discrimination towards particular class of people revealed. And I certainly hope that something is done about it. At the very LEAST a PUBLIC apology to the men and women that she has insulted with her song. And even PERSONALLY here on social media and on youtube BEFORE she (of course) deleted them. Hopefully someone was able to gather some screen shots. If anyone has some let me know. As I have been and will continue to write corp office daily until we find out that something has been done about this.","2016-02-29T19:54:35+0000","147570341990082_987951557951952","Walmart300"
"If Sarah brand was any type of ""professional "" she wouldn't have made such a stereotyped video. Do you know how many people probably don't want to fill their meds anymore because of her? Life saving meds at that! I understand she has frustrations but there are much better and professional ways to relieve those frustrations!","2016-02-28T18:22:57+0000","147570341990082_987286088018499","Walmart300"
"This is in regards to Sarah Brands video.  First- she has an amazing voice, hands down.  Such a shame to ruin it the way she did.  I will tell you personally, it makes me wonder why my pharmacist thinks of me now.  Suboxone has saved my life.  I actually have a family now.  I actually am here for my daughter, which I am going to shamefully admit publicly because that's the truth.  This Christmas was amazing for her, my weekends off, is amazing with her.  I work in a nursing home, with long term care patients on a lockdown unit, which I feel I owe to Suboxone, because I am now stable enough to work.  I was an addict for 10 plus years, I am now 31, living with my parents and finally sober, and stable, thanks to Suboxone.  She is a disgrace to your company, and I can honestly say, I am truly uncomfortable to go to my OWN pharmacy, where my own pharmacist has never rolled an eye at me for change the quantity because I couldn't afford them all, because I am a private pay patient.  I wonder what he says about me when I leave.  Does he roll his eye the way she does?  Does he think I am some druggie needing my fix, when I feel like I am finally a person who has worth again?  Thank you Sarah for ruining my relationship with my pharmacist because of your obnoxious bad day video.  I am sorry you had a bad day, yes we all have them, but if I came on here and bashed my patients the way you did, I guarantee that I wouldn't have a job, nor a license.  But that's not here or there.  The point is, you have made me uncomfortable-all the way in Virginia and that I wish I could pick up my prescription and feel no judgement.  Which I have not felt for the past 9 months since I got sober, on Suboxone. and not spending my checks or child support.  Point is you have really really made me people unhappy, an apology wouldn't even matter since it is so funny to you the responses your getting.  SO yes, this is from one of your haters, and Id never say I hated you, that's too strong of a word to waste on you.   I hope you never feel a day of what you have made us feel like.  Thank you Wal-Mart for allowing me to post and to stick up for myself, that is something I have learned while on Suboxone and in RECOVERY.  God Bless You ALL.","2016-02-27T04:55:51+0000","147570341990082_986407588106349","Walmart300"
"Your company should be ashamed. Your employees are the face and voice of your company...yet you employ Sarah Brand in your pharmacy, who feels it is perfectly acceptable to make a parody and make fun of YOUR customers! Your customers who are recovering from addiction, your customers who are prescribed painkillers or anti anxiety meds, you're customers who are on Medicaid. Do you know how many people that is??? She offended a LOT of people. And apparently since she is still employed Walmart feels it is acceptable to make fun of those who battle the disease of addiction, those who suffer from extreme anxiety, and those who are on Medicaid. How disgusting. Isn't a pharmacist (or even a pharmacy tech) there to help each customer with kindness and understanding?!? Without judging someone just because of the medication they are on or assuming every person is a messed up junkie?!? She needs a reality check, an education in addiction, and also proper customer service and professionalism skills... Apparently Walmarts pharmacy have no idea what ethics means because according to Sarah Brand her boss and employer thinks this video if hers is hilarious as well. If that is the case Walmart I hope you prepare yourselves to lose many customers.","2016-02-23T14:32:30+0000","147570341990082_984396651640776","Walmart300"
"I'm extremely disappointed by the video Sarah Brand posted.  She's a pharm tech in your store.  She has made a video and posted it publicly on Facebook and YouTube.  My question to you is this....why would anyone be allowed to humiliate anyone in your store??  I realize that pharmacy employees have a difficult job and I'm sure they get frustrated as I do in my own job.  However her display of this frustration is completely appalling.  She mocks ppl on Suboxone, Valium, Oxycontin, Norco, Xanax, and mocks customers on Medicaid.  I wonder how your customers would feel seeing her video??  Would they change pharmacies??  I believe the worst part about the whole thing is when people have commented negatively to her video.....Sarah has mocked them, their disease, and reinforced her position that all people on these medications are addicts.  This is plain ignorance and I hope that you will take a stand and ensure that Sarah doesn't continue to criticize the same customers that help her to stay employed.  Thank you for your time.  I pray that this will be handled immediately.  \n\nSincerely, \nNicole Randall","2016-02-23T11:42:15+0000","147570341990082_984332304980544","Walmart300"

"Why is it that every time I go to Jacksonville Wal-Mart, it seems everyone forgets how to put their buggy away. And the lazy people decide it's a GREAT idea to park the buggy against another person's vehicle when a place to put your buggy is literally two steps away from where you are, AND to do this while someone is sitting in the vehicle WATCHING you???\nSTOP BEING LAZY. Put your buggy away like a normal, decent human being. \nMaybe Wal-Mart should do like Aldi and make you put a quarter in to get a buggy, then people will darn sure remember to put their buggy's away correctly.","2014-08-14T21:16:05+0000","147570341990082_697436550336789","Walmart300"
