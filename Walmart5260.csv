"As we were leaving just a few min ago a gentleman rushed up to the two Hispanic girls at the entry way. He told them he lost his child then described the child to them. Their response was OK we have not seen the child but, you can go to the service desk and tell them. The gentleman then walked off. My husband  then confronted the girls and told them they did not handle that very well and they should prob of got into contact with a manger right then. Their response.... Well that's his second time telling us. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!  You need to address your missing child policy's with your employees!!! If you have a missing child the last thing you want is two girls have no care about it and just shoo you away! I can handle the team members  just standing around and avoiding people as they walk by all the time. But avoiding a missing child is not acceptable!!!","2016-10-01T16:06:39+0000","156654311084374_1134573156625813","Walmart5260",
"It was an outpouring of love, appreciation, school supplies and accordion music for Rogers New Technology HS Spanish teacher Martin Resendiz today. Selected as one of 20 teachers in the country for the Commander in Teach recognition from Walmart, Mr. Resendiz received supplies and a Walmart giftcard for $490, the average amount a teacher spends out of pocket for classroom supplies. Loved as a mentor, coach, and parent group leader, Mr. Resendiz was serenaded by one of his students playing his favorite song on the accordion while other students sang along. Thank you to Walmart Rogers - Pleasant Crossing Blvd and all those who recognize the hard work of teachers!!","2016-09-22T17:04:36+0000","156654311084374_1126369637446165","Walmart5260","Rogers Public Schools added 6 new photos."

"We  would just like to see THREE (3) things...  We love this pickup service!  \n\n1) But we wish we could schedule same day pickup online.  When we click on ""reserve a time"", there is never the ability to choose ""same day"".  \n\n2) After searching for an item, we wish you could sort the results by price.  That would save us the time of jumping to walmart.com to find the best deal.\n\n3) We like going to Pleasant Crossing because it is a Supercenter.  We live in Springdale and the newest Neighborhood Market has pickup, but we like ordering from a supercenter.  Wish you could have pickup at the Supercenter on Elm Springs Road.  That is VERY close to us and we'd like to keep our purchases in Springdale.\n\nWe love this service!  We think it saves us money.  Because we will take the time to find the best deal online.  When we're in the store, we don't want to take the time.  We just want to get home.  :)\n\nTHANK YOU WALMART !!!

I called the store looking for a specific ribbon and was transferred to Brianne. She wasn't able to  locate it on the ribbon shelf for me right away so she then took my number and called me back shortly saying she had found what I was looking for after taking the time to search through the clearance carts for me!!

"Your CSM Karina needs to learn her coupon lingo. When a coupon reads ""limit one coupon per purchase"" that does not mean that I can't use 5 coupons for 5 of the same item. This just means I can't use 5 coupons for the purchase of 1 item. I had over 50 coupons which is what prompted the CSM to come to the register I was at. Please take the time and teach people how to read coupons so that other people are not frustrated as I was today. I also had to wait an extra 10 min for the CSM to come over which the ladies behind me where trying to save them down because they had somewhere to be too.

After I waited the 45 minutes that I was told it would take, it still had not been filled because, apparently, your pharmacist and clerk don't know that October is the tenth month or that the 24th day of the month is after the 5th. I was extremely frustrated to say the least. This is not the first time something like this has happened at this location. I understand that it was a busy evening in the pharmacy, but the tenth month is definitely October and it is definitely past the 5th, but my child is still without his medication.","2015-10-25T03:47:19+0000","156654311084374_915013915248406","Walmart5260",

"Hello to the managers and all associates at this wonderful store---want to share the following with you.  As I was taking home my grandson yesterday, he wanted to stop in and see if he could find some cheap running shoes.  He's no longer playing football, but wants to stay in condition and running is part of his regimen.  We went to the shoe area (between 4 and 4:30 p.m on 8/13) where your associate asked if he could help.  He directed my grandson to the other side of the aisle, but nothing caught his eye.  We went back around to where we were and your associate asked if he might be interested in their clearance shoes and promptly took us over to the clearance.  We looked at several and trying on to make sure they fit.  The 3rd pair he picked up and tried were a hit.  As my grandson pulled out $10 from his wallet, he commented, ""Grandma these are nice shoes, and thanks to Walmart's employee who directed me to them, I got a $30 pair of shoes for only $9+tax"".   So you need to know that you made my grandson (who turns l5 today), a very happy camper and impressed with the assistance he received.  Thank you so much and keep up the great customer service and training employees how important that customer service provided is to customers.   Kudos to that employee (I was remiss in not seeing his name) and to the Walmart Rogers - Pleasant Crossing Blvd crew!   LOVE THIS STORE FOR THIS VERY REASON!
