"I am shocked at how bad customer service has become at Walmart. I went to shop at the neighborhood market in Spring Hill FL last night. I spent a good 30 minutes shopping in this store. When I got to the bread aisle, which was one of the main reasons for going there, they had NO white bread. The excuse I got from the assistant manager was that there was inventory so no vendors were there yesterday. This I terrible customer service and I walked out leaving about $200 worth of groceries behind","2016-10-04T17:09:33+0000","159616034235_10154721496869236","walmart",

"Selfish, entitled thieves. A few hours ago, I was in Walmart with Auri & Allan. We were in the oral care aisle looking at toothbrushes and floss, I angled my body slightly away from my cart to talk to Auri about which floss she wanted to use with her braces. Instantly, I had this urgent feeling to turn around, I glanced down at my purse and looked at the woman that was next to my cart. I didn’t even have time to think, but my reaction came from my mouth….”Are you serious, did you really just take my freakin’ wallet, you really just took my wallet like its ok” and I firmly said, “Give it back to me right now!” I snatched my wallet from her hand and loudly said, “Get security, this woman just stole my wallet.” She gives me my wallet back and says, ""OK I gave it back""...like this was suppose to make it ok. While this is all happening, only a few feet away (A FEW FEET AWAY), a Walmart employee (would you believe someone in security) looked at me…he looked at us. I am looking at him in his face and still saying get security, people from the pharmacy are looking, and other customers are looking. I trail this woman with my cart, although not intentional, as I trail her I am so close that I am actually hitting the back of her ankles with my cart. We move out of the aisle, pass the pharmacy, to the front entrance. As this is going on, I am still loudly saying someone get security, this woman just stole my wallet and the Walmart employee is still close by (doing nothing at all). We get to the front entrance where the actual security personnel stands, she walks (not run) swiftly pass the guy, I look at him and yell….”stop her, she just stole my wallet, will security do anything?” By this time, other customers are in disbelief, they can’t believe what is happening and they take off after the woman, passing security. One gentleman returns and says, she just left, she just drove off. By this time, other customers are in total disbelief, just as I am, wondering how someone would be so bold to just stick their hands in another person’s purse. I look at security with disappointment, pass them and head to customer service to file a complaint. A complaint about the woman, only God knows how many others she has done this to or will do this do (especially since they just let her go). Thankfully I got my wallet back, but how unfortunate would this situation be for someone that did not notice the thief in action. The other complaint was about security because they did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! After I spoke with the customer service supervisor, I returned to shopping with my children. The Walmart employee that was close by when this happened approached me and explained how, because she returned my wallet, he could not restrain her. I politely cut him off and refreshed his memory, she did not return the wallet; I actually took it from her. I also told him that he should have still restrained her and did something, because she’s going to do it again to someone else. The conversation ended and I was left with my children. I hated that they had to witness all that, although I did raise my voice to make a statement and be heard, I did not act foolishly and I kept my composure. Allan and Auri said mommy, you are still smiling, how are you smiling? Have you ever had something so crazy HAPPEN TO you that you just laugh from disbelief; I really believe that is what I was experiencing? \nSeriously…to the thief, what in your head makes it ok to even think that you are entitled to take something that belongs to someone else? How unbelievably selfish, inconsiderate and embarrassing.\n\nWhatever happened to the GOLDEN RULE..treat others how you wanted to be treated?","2016-10-04T15:20:52+0000","159616034235_10154721229544236","walmart",

"Below is the information off of our receipt from our visit last night:\n\nMANAGER AMANDA RIVENBARK\n4000 RED BANK RD\nCINCINNATI OH 45227\nST#02250 OP#006912 TE#04 TR#00796\nTERMINAL#SC010889\n10/03/16   19:01:07\n\nI wanted to make you aware of the cashier that was working during this transaction.  We did not see her name on the receipt, but I am sure you can reference who was assigned to the register and terminal.  I encourage you to review the tapes on her as well.  She was a heavyset older black woman with extremely short hair.  \n\nFirst, when we stepped into her line, the women in front of us only had half a conveyer belt worth of groceries left to scan.  We stood there I’m sure for at least a good twenty minutes if not more.  We watched a young couple come in with a baby, go through the store, check out in another line, and pass in front of our line again all before we even started to have our things rung up!  The cashier was very rude to the women in front of us, and when the one woman handed her some cash (while holding her debit card right in front of the woman!), the cashier kept recounting the money then looked up nastily and said, “You didn’t give me enough money!”  They woman smiled politely and held her debit card even higher, explaining that she was paying the difference with her card.  The cashier snapped, “You think I’m a mind reader?!”  She never thanked the ladies before us, and started ringing up our stuff before they even got the rest of their bags and purse gathered up.\n\nMy husband and I tried to engage the cashier in conversation, but she wouldn’t speak to us.  Then, my 7 year old daughter tried to fluff out a bag to be helpful, and the woman snapped at my daughter, “Don’t touch that!!” in very nasty voice.  I just told my daughter to keep back.  I kept my cool, but I wanted to say, “That’s not your child!  It’s not your grandchild!  Don’t speak to my daughter that way.”  But, I kept my mouth shut, and my husband didn’t hear her as he was standing down with the groceries.\n\nThen, to make matters worse, I was leaning over to get a bag off the carousel, and the woman slammed down a bag she put with a large container of bubble bath and the large bag of Epsom salt you all carry.  She slammed me in the head with it, and when I snapped my head up to see if she was even going to apologize, she smirked at me, then turned to my husband and said, “You should keep the heavy stuff in your cart!”.  He didn’t see her slam my head with the heavy bag, because he was watching for everything to ring up correctly, but I was astonished.  I didn’t want my husband to get upset, and I already wasn’t feeling well, so I just wanted to wait to tell him what was happening until we left the store.\n\nAs we walked out to the parking lot, he said, “Wow, did you hear her say we should keep the heavy stuff in the cart?!”  I said, “Yes, did you see her slam my head with the bag before she said that?!”  He wanted to march back in and find a manager, but I just wanted to go home.  I took a picture of the receipt, so I could make sure to send off these letters and let you know about her.  She bruised my head, and it’s still sore this morning where she hit me.  She has no place in customer service or anywhere around people for that matter.  It was completely ridiculous.  How can she hit a customer in the head, not apologize, and then blame us for putting something “heavy” on the conveyer belt???  Something needs to be done about this, because we are really not happy.\n\nI thank you for your time and look forward to hearing back from someone regarding this soon.","2016-10-04T14:51:11+0000","159616034235_10154721158574236","walmart",

"@asda So you take an authorisation for shopping, you tell the customer all is well, you then tell the customer the order will be delivered early and then you cancel the order but keep the authorisation so they can't spend the money somewhere else. Poor customer service leaving a young family with a small child with no food or the ability to spend the money in store as you have not released the authorisation, then you lie constantly on the phone until you eventually admit it was a technical glitch, but its not your fault. Also whats with the customers services department keep hanging up on calls, is this a way of getting rid of problems. Then finally after and hour and half on the phone the operator offers an e-voucher of £15 and hangs up so I doubt that will appear on the account #asda #thesun","2016-10-04T13:49:36+0000","159616034235_10154721018049236","walmart",

I was never notified about the bike being lost and I had even paid extra money for the order to be expedited. The women I spoke to was very rude and said she could not overnight the bike or even give it the expedited shipping I had originally paid for.  She offered to ship another bike (same make and model) but it has been 5 days and there is no tracking info for the new bike either. \nWith the money I have spent on taxis getting to and from work, I could have gotten another, much nicer bike from a store and had it already.

"Walmart really needs to overhaul the Ashtabula, Ohio store. The store is disgusting and the majority of the employees are rude. \nYesterday I went in there around 5p, it is the first of the month, there was only 4 registers open with really long lines. There was one set 3 self check outs open being managed by a girl that thought her friends and phone were more important. This elderly man needed help with the self check out register and she told him to wait while she talked to someone leaving. Then came back and asked the guy ""What did you do?"". Like he broke the machine. My daughter was returning a dress and there was three people at Customer Service, only one was helping people. The other two were having a loud personal conversation. After they were done the one employee comes to the counter with a attitude and asks if she can help the next person. There were 4 people in line, wr were second, by the time we left 24 min later and the employees disbursed, there was 11 people.  Unfortunately this store is all some people have.

That one of your stories getting a tire today put on was extremely hungry was planning to have dinner when I had a blown tire so went into the Walmart Marco Island… no restaurant was open it was a closed Burger King in there.. so go to the Walmart deli the chicken looked pretty old and it was very dry they didn't have any fresh coming so I look at the shrimp they just came out nice gorgeous fried shrimp looks nice but no cocktail sauce the manager even said nope we don't have cocktail sauce we have fish too and no tartar sauce... Let me tell you something Walmart it is not hard to make you have all the ingredients in the store cocktail sauce is ketchup and horseradish tartar sauce is mayonnaise and relish it's not rocket science if it costs more than charge a quarter a piece for it on the side but who wants shrimp without cocktail sauce\nNeedless to say I didn't get any","2016-10-04T04:16:45+0000","159616034235_10154719906839236","walmart",

"I literally spent 90 mins of my life trying to order a hoagie tray from the store in Springfield Pa. I called and was placed on hold so I drove to the store. When I got there, the guy who takes the orders was on lunch (apparently only ONE person can take a hoagie order?!) for 45 minutes. I had some shopping to do and came back 40 minutes later and waited....again. he never came back. I waited 20 minutes and left. I called when I got home..they were closed. This morning I called again and was placed on hold 5 times each for at least 5 minutes each time. I asked to speak with a manager and was told he wasn't there so I asked to speak to ANY manager....no answer. Why is it so hard to order a SANDWICH!!!!!! I called again...same routine..hold. I called South Philly. Shondra answered. She said she couldn't do orders but she would write down what she could and get the prices. The phone had static so she took down my number in case it disconnected. She even offered to call me back from her personal phone if she couldn't get the call through. She was amazing and took care of everything in less than 5 minutes. I just want to know why Springfield literally wasted my time over something so simple?!","2016-10-04T01:05:21+0000","159616034235_10154719585094236","walmart",

"Can you please clarify what your policy is on selling alcohol? We seem to be having some issues with our local Wal-Marts requiring ALL members of a group to provide ID. My husband was recently at the Charlotte Pike Wal-Mart in Nashville, TN and he was with our children. He bought a 6 pack of beer (his 2nd 6 pack in 20 years) and they wanted ID on our children! When he cited the law to them, he was given a lecture on underage drinking by the associate, and how he had better not be giving it to his children! At our local Fairview, TN Wal-Mart, they are doing the same. Refusing to sell alcohol if everyone in the group doesn't have ID. Mum's the word from our local Wal-Marts, but the law says, the person purchasing needs to show ID, not everyone else. Can you please let us know what your policy is, because there are no signs that state everyone in the group must show ID. Local associates are reporting that in training they are told, if they do not ID everyone in the group, they will be terminated. If your policy is to require ID for EVERYONE near or around the purchasing person, then quite frankly, you need to post your policy because your associates are not following the law.","2016-10-03T23:48:40+0000","159616034235_10154719468979236","walmart",
"Customer Service Question:  My 70 year old Aunt Karen purchased a television from your Lapeer, Michigan location.  When they arrived home with their new purchase they couldnt find an owners manual or remote.  When presented to the store, a completely different television that should have been in the box was in their purchase.  They told her that the serial number didn't match, so tough luck.  They basically accused her of pulling a scam.  In my opinion, management should have looked for previous returns of that particular product to their store before making such accusations.  Your stores aren't known for checking products prior to placing them back on the shelves.  Years ago I purchased a crock pot only to get in home and food was completely stuck to the inside.

"I have to get my meds filled at different places now that we don't have insurance.  This evening in a rush I went to the wrong Walmart.  It was 12 mins til closing and I desperately needed my medicine since I went without it last night.  I asked the location I was at if they thought the other pharmacy would wait if they knew I was coming.  The tech said no I'd never make it.  I stood in Walmart and wanted to cry.  I decided to call on my own and the other pharmacist, at the store across from the Savannah Mall, was beyond nice.  She said she would wait!  I was only 2-3 minutes late but I couldn't thank her enough.\n\nWhile I was there I checked the clearance section out and boy was I blown away.  I've never seen a more organized dept in a Walmart much less a clearence section.  The young man was polite and helped customers as he diligently worked.  I watched him for a few minutes then told him what an excellent job he was doing and asked if I could take pictures to share his hard work.  He stopped for a second and went right back to work.  \n\nAs a business owner I live and breath customer service.  And if you know me you know I believe in giving credit where credit is due.  I have to commend this store on the level of customer service I received from every employee I interacted with this evening.  \n\nI'm sharing this positive experience because I want them to see a customer noticed!

"I'm so furious with your Pueblo West Colorado tire and lube station!!!!!!!!!!!! I took a tire there at 1130am and all I needed them to do was mount and balance on a rim for me that I had given them. The gentleman told me it would be a two hour wait. I was a little irritated but they were busy so I gave him my number to call me when it was ready and I had a family member take me home. I didn't hear from them the entire day. I had to use my husband's car to go to work so I didn't get a chance to call and ask if the tire was ready. I called around 7pm and they had already closed...after getting the runaround on the phone for about 10 min Max helped me out and said there was a tire at the front lobby. I didn't get off work till 11, but Antonio and Max helped me get back there and come to find out they didn't even do my tire!!!!!!!! it literally just sat there all day long! What kind of crap is this! People have lives! Because of your staff I'm now out of work for a day or pay for a taxi. Have to find some way to get my kids to school and my baby to daycare. And then get myself to college that night. I don't just bring my tire down for it to just sit there. I wasted my whole morning when I could have found an alternate plan. First my car breaks down then I have to change my tire on my second vehicle to use it and now I can't because of your poorly ran staff. How could you not even call and let me know! I will never use your tire service again. Completely unreliable! What is going to happen now?! I will be calling the manager in the morningx but who knows if his staff treats customers like this they are probably no better. I'm so disappointed . It needs to start at the top!

"i had a bad experience at my walmart today:( i'm not very happy. let me preface this story by saying: i'm poor. im 18 and live independently with my boyfriend. we both work retail. so yeah, we don't have plenty of money to spare. i have been eyeing this leaning full-length mirror at walmart for a few months now, because i'd like one for my bedroom and walmart has great prices on home decor items. i've been waiting for it to go on sale because it's normal price ($44) is a bit much for me to spend on home decor in my current financial state, regardless of what a bargain it is. well, today was my lucky day! i was browsing the home aisles and saw that it was on sale for $29! there was two left in the stack! i was very excited. BUT such a good price for the mirror seemed too good to be true, and i figured it might be in the wrong spot. so i didn't jump on it. i waited until the next day(which was today) to come back and make sure it really WAS on sale. i drove out 30 minutes again today to go to the exact walmart. and there was indeed still 2 mirrors left in that exact spot with the price marked as $29! i actually took a picture of the sale to send to my boyfriend and tell him how excited i was the mirror i liked was finally on sale! i put it in my cart and brought it to the front.. where i then waited in line for a good 30 minutes. the mirror rung up as $44.... i figured it must be a mistake.. i showed the cashier the picture i took for my boyfriend, and he said he'd have to send a manager to go make sure it was really correct.. i thought okay.. well i'm sure they'll see that the price is clearly marked there? they came back and compared the barcode on the mirror and sale sign, and they were different(which is obvious already, because if they were the same, it would've rung up as $29??!!) so they said ""a customer could've moved it there so we can't honor the price"" but even if a customer moved it there, couldn't they have moved it back when they did overnight stocking? there was 24 hours in between when i saw it, and when i came back to purchase! i couldn't really afford to spend the $44 on a mirror, so i had to put it back... in front of a big line of people who had to wait on me the entire time this process was going down. anybody who has experienced NOT ONLY HAVING TO HAVE SOMEBODY RE-CHECK THE PRICE, but having to PUT AN ITEM BACK because you can't afford it, knows how totally humiliating the experience is. and the worst part is i'm a very soft-spoken person so i'm not very great at defending myself or speaking up for myself, so i didn't want to ask about the price anyways.. it really sucked and i left feeling super embarrassed almost to the point of tears. i usually go to this walmart in-particular because the customer service is usually way better than the one closer to my house, but this has made me not want to shop at either one of them! :( i just wanted the store-error pricing to be honored.. like i said earlier, i work retail, so i know the struggle of maintaining a store's profit margin, but when there's an error in price tags, you always honor it. (or AT THE VERY LEAST, offer a 20% discount for the disappointment??) that's just how customer service works. severely disappointed :( if this can be solved, thru corporate, please let me know. because this isn't the service i'm used to when it comes to walmart. you guys have never let me down like this before.","2016-10-03T04:02:14+0000","159616034235_10154717091259236","walmart",

"I cannot express how much I absolutely hate the walmart store in Orange City FL.  I went there the first of the week to get my Claritin D in the pharmacy to have the girl go totally out of sequence on the way she got my claritin off the shelf.  Before looking to see if she even had the 12 hours 30 tablet packages, she took my drivers license, gave me a hard time because it is a TN. license, asking how long I've been in FL and why do I have a TN license and will I be returning to TN in the near future.  First of all, WHAT business is that of hers?  FL. has alot of snow birds and tourists and out of state licenses are not out of the norm.  Anyway, she scans my license, gives me a hard time about it, then she looks for my claritin D in the 12 hour 30 package, comes back to the register and BOOM.  Electric goes out, it takes a few minutes for the generator to kick in and when it does, she asks for my license again because she has to start the whole transaction again.  Well she looks at me and says she can't sell me that claritin because I've already had it filled the same day.  No, you scanned my license, went on a tyraid about it being out of state and asked me questions that were none of your business, went to get the med, lost the system and that's the ""purchase"" you claim I've made the same day.  So since you didn't, in fact, sell me the claritin, override the system or whatever you have to do because I have pneumonia and my doctor wants me on my claritin D so that I can clear my head and get well.  No, she can't do that.  So because of your store personnels nosiness, loss of electric and down system, I am, once again, without my claritin D for 15 days because now I'm on the registry, government she pointed out to me, that says I did get the claritin, when I didn't.  I will NEVER, and i reiterate NEVER shop that store again.\n\nThe store is mold ridden, everyone who goes in there has watery eyes and stuffed noses after being in there for 10 minutes or more, you can smell it in fabrics and textiles on the shelves, you can smell it in the store, the management is so worried about their bonuses and not about employees or customers that they could care less if the store is running properly or store shelves are stocked and this is not the first issue I've had with the prescription department.  I'll go to the store in Deland or not shop Walmart any longer period.  Every purchase I make lately has to be returned because the merchandise is cheap, defective, returned and put back on the shelf, or doesn't work.  More times than I can count items are not even stocked and your personnel never knows when it will be in stock again, or IF it will be in stock again.  Orange City Walmart is a joke.  I don't know how else to describe it,  you'd think the government runs it.","2016-10-03T02:33:17+0000","159616034235_10154716914479236","walmart",

"Hi.  I went to my local Walmart in Valparaiso Indiana and stopped at the Ben's Pretzels store and got a hot dog.  To my dismay(since I'm allergic to cow milk) I discovered after eating most of it, that it had cheese included.\n\nI spoke with the store and understand that they feel that if someone has a question they should ask... the onus is on the person with the allergy.  I don't think that's a fair attitude.   I do agree that if a user has an expectation that a product might be used... they should ask.   For instance, if they were serving chowder, I would know to ask cow's milk was added.   I've had pretzels at other vendors, but the never contained cheese.  There's no reasonable way for me to expect that cheese might be an ingredient.\n\nI'm requesting for all of us who have dairy allergies, that you insist that the Ben's Pretzel store include a short description that indicates that cheese is included in the pretzel hot dog.\n\nThank you.","2016-10-03T00:39:43+0000","159616034235_10154716688274236","walmart",

We get there only to have them tell me that one of the drops they would not have until Tuesday.\nSo we ask them if we could just go to a different Wal-Mart today.

So we leave and go to the Wal-Mart on 7hwy in Shawnee.\nDOUG the nicest pharmacist and my new pharmacist talks with us on the phone on our way to his store. Makes sure he has the meds in stock.\nWhen we arrive we find out that Leavenworth has marked my scripts filled in Leavenworth so I can’t have them in Shawnee. So Jane has to call Leavenworth and go through who we are, where we are, and why we are in Shawnee with a very rude lady in Leavenworth. While trying to fix the issues Leavenworth tells us that my scripts are now no good!! They have deactivated them!!\nTo make this long story short. After over 2 hours of Jane and Doug dealing with the MORONS in Leavenworth both of my scripts were filled at our new Wal-Mart in Shawnee. Where we then did our shopping and spent $100’s of dollars more than the $20 script.\nNow guess what, its only 5 minutes further away than the crappy Leavenworth Store and it’s clean, well-stocked and the staff is friendly!!! No more tax money for Leavenworth, Leavenworth County or money Leavenworth’s Wal-Mart.\n\nThe End","2016-10-03T00:23:34+0000","159616034235_10154716663234236","walmart",
"It's been 5 or 6 weeks and I still have not heard from anyone from Walmart about my complaint about a broken hypodermic needle found in my daughter's toy. You (Walmart Facebook representative) have told me multiple times that someone would contact me and I have been patiently waiting but alas I have heard nothing from anyone. To prevent tragic accident that may occur to other children who happen to own toys from the same company, I have submitted my complaint to ABC news and will do what it takes to publicize this public health danger.

"Today I had gone into walmart with my two new puppies. They are both only 7 weeks old and have had all their shots. As I was doing my usual shopping a an associate asked me to leave because of my dogs.....now why is that? My puppies were simply sleeping in the car with a blanket under them. He expected me to leave them in a car with 90 degree weather if you live in utah you know summers can be brutal. I have never had problems with other walmarts before. In case some associates come and say hi to the puppies.

"While traveling home from Des Moines, my wife and I were going through Mt. Ayr, Iowa and saw a Walmart semi stopped on the highway. There were several dogs around the truck. We also stopped because we thought we saw a dog under the truck. Turned out to be a goat, the dogs had chased under the truck. The goat was unhurt, but to scared to come out. The driver wasn't going to move until the goat was rescued. He and I worked to try and get it to come out. Another bystander got on the other side and pulled the goat out by its hind legs. All was good! I checked the number on the tractor and it was 16-0172. I didn't get the trailer number, but this guy deserves a commendation.

"Today was an interesting day at Walmart  in Cuba Missouri. We finished our shopping and started out the door. As we passed though, the anti theft device started beeping. We went back inside through it and it went off again. Then again when we walked through it briefly. I just figured something in our bag had a thing on it that did not get deactivated. The cashier came up and told the two that were stopping us that there was not anything in our stuff to set it off. We went through one at a time and when my daughter went through, it beeped again. They said that it was in her stuff. They went through our bags and they had my daughter show them what was in her pockets. There was nothing there. Then we walked back through again one at a time and it did not go off. It had gone off at least 4 times. At that point I was at a loss thinking their unit was malfunctioning. They let us leave. As we made it through the last door, it went off again and my husband turned around. He saw the lady that had stopped us with something in her hand setting it off. He confronted her and said, ""That was you setting it off wasn't it?"" She said yes, turned around and walked away. This whole thing was a setup to illegally detain my daughter and search her, by which they found she did not do anything wrong. We've never been so unjustly humiliated at Walmart before.","2016-10-02T21:20:07+0000","159616034235_10154716310949236","walmart",

There was no one working in sporting goods, the lady from the craft department tried to help, she told me the sporting goods person came in at noon; seriously???.  So she called the department manager, Jorge, for help.  He told her that Walmart does not sell ammunition before 9:00AM. When I spoke to Jorge myself, he stated ""that is Walmart policy.""  Since when?  I bought ammunition before 8:00AM at that location before.  I informed Jorge that there was no federal regulation concerning ammunition purchase times and not only had they sold it to me before that time, so had other Walmart stores.  So it was that particular Walmart's policy and a new one I suppose.  Please contact them and let them know that if it is indeed their, or your, policy then someone needs to post a notice.

"Today I have a rant!!!!! Walmart consumer replacement plans are not what they are describe to be. Consumers should think twice before buying this plan especially on Black Friday!\nTrue story: On Black Friday (2015) Mr. No-name purchased a LG cell phone from Walmart. The regular price was $99.00 but the Black Friday sale price was $25.00. At the register the cashier offered him a 2 year REPLACEMENT plan. The cashier stated it would protect against accidental damage if the phone is damaged because it dropped (i.e. broken glass). The phone was for a 11 year old so it was a no-brainer. The problem herein lies: replacement is misleading (actually, blatant lie) because it does not mean replacement of the phone... it means they will to give you the Black Friday sale price back for the phone. If that was what they meant then that is exactly what they should have stated at the time of the sale of the plan and not the misleading security that the phone would be replaced. The customer service representative asked if we read the replacement agreement at the time of purchase. (This was not provided prior to purchase....he only had info that was represented by the cashier about the plan). In other words... not until after the purchase does the consumer have access to the agreement and the misleading sense of security of their product replacement plan. THIS IS ALL KINDS OF WRONG! I think Wal-Mart lied and misrepresented the consumer on this product replacement plan. So to all consumers everywhere..... REPLACEMENT DOES NOT MEAN REPLACEMENT!!!!! Know what you are buying before you purchase another replacement plan from retailers and especially from Walmart.\nThank you and my rant is over!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I feel a little better now","2016-10-02T13:01:21+0000","159616034235_10154714983854236","walmart",

That was the only place I had used my card in quite some time, and the last place I used it before I started getting random charges all over south Atlanta yesterday (again, at Walmarts). Since I still have the card in hand, I'm guessing the gas pump had a skimmer on it.

He chose a $29.98 box of Yugioh cards, a regular Yugioh booster pack for $3.33 and a Pokemon 4-pack that was marked $4.18. The price on the Pokemon set seemed too good to be true, but the peg hook was completely filed with them. When we got to the checkout it rang up $12.98. I questioned it, showed the rep where we got it, etc. Any other retailer with good customer service would have given us the cards at the advertised price and removed the incorrect pricing. Not your store. That is fine though. I worked in management in retail for over 10 years. I NEVER would have done that to a customer when it was obviously our companies mistake. I understand it was a huge difference in price, but it was only 1 pack. Some of the worse customer service I have ever experienced. By the way, these items were not all we purchased tonight. We normally spend $200 - 300 every 2 weeks there. I think I will start taking my business to a different store - one that knows how to do right by their customers.","2016-10-02T03:15:13+0000","159616034235_10154713682534236","walmart",
"Hi! I just wanted to tell you guys about my Force Friday experience this year. I knew it wouldn't be much like last year, considering there was no big event or anything, just the release of all the new figures. My boyfriend and I, being huge nerds and collectors, ended up going out at midnight, in hopes of getting first pick of the new Black Series figures. Well, our local Wal-Mart in Gettysburg, PA had already been picked clean. It looked like customers had taken the boxes straight from the untouched pallet and ripped them open before they could even make it to the shelves. I did find one box and the employees that I had asked were happy to help me open it, even though they were busy dealing with their renovations that were happening.\n\nIt ended up not being the right series that we were looking for. So we moved on to the Hanover, the store on Eisenhower Drive. We were hopeful, seeing how few customers there were at that time, about 12:45 or so. While there wasn't anything on the shelves or on the pallets, we still decided to ask for help, just to see if there were more. There wasn't any sign of people tearing open boxes, after all, so maybe they were just someplace we hadn't seen yet!\n\nI don't remember the name of the woman that helped us, but she dropped her task immediately to help me find out. She ended up going to a manager for a definitive answer, which was, sadly, if they still had them, they would be out. But all was not lost, because she cheerfully gave us directions to the other Wal-Mart in town. I'd never visited that one but she made sure that I wouldn't lose my way there. Since I didn't have a SKU to check, we had no idea of whether or not we were in for victory or defeat there.\n\nBut the South Hanover store was a treat, and I mean that with no sarcasm at all. I DO remember the name of the gentleman who helped us there. Joe. Joe was an absolute angel. I've never met a nicer person, and ESPECIALLY not at 1 in the freaking morning. He made sure his area in Electronics was looked after before he listened to our story in full and getting all the details he could about which figures we were looking for. And after that, that wonderful man went in the back and came out with an armful of boxes. \n\nIt was allll the new Rogue One figures and vehicles and masks that he had seen with that street date. He sat there patiently and helped us open the boxes and see what was in each, so that we knew for sure whether it was what we wanted or not. And when that first armful didn't succeed, he went back for another and repeated the process. Unfortunately, none of them were what we were looking for, and bless him, he didn't even look annoyed. Not even a little. He went back to his job and, even without buying anything, I made sure to stop and find the manager on duty to let him know how great Joe was and how helpful and wonderful he was.\n\nThe reason why I'm telling you this is because I know how little appreciation the night crew usually gets and how mad some people are for not being able to find what they're looking for. But everyone in those three stores, they were wonderful, they were helpful, and no matter how big of a collector I consider myself, I'm not even angry about not being able to find it because I know the people I asked did all they could to help me out.\n\nSo, the short story is, thank you for being awesome, and I hope you let your crews know how amazing they were.","2016-10-02T03:00:40+0000","159616034235_10154713659499236","walmart",

"Wal-Mart on Winchester in Memphis TN has horrible customer service and employees.  Went to pick up my site to store order up from the layaway/site to store department. Was greeted with unprofessional and rude cashiers.  They had me waiting over an hour.  I was told the young lady who pick orders was out looking for my order.. lies..The manager, and employees couldn't find the girl who works the department. Called for her over 5 Times over loud speaker.  She finally came in saying she was on break. Then preceded to try an find my order.  Took another 30 minutes to finally get my order but while in the back looking for my order I overheard them talking about me using profanity.

"Walmart.\n\nI still haven't received the link needed for this promotion; www.walmart.com/watchfree. I've contacted Walmart.com customer service, customer relations, I've been told to call Sling & VUDU, which I did. I was instructed by the last person who answered my post here to try the online ""chat"" and they promised an escalated response within 48 hours. That was 5 days ago. \n\nI called customer relations again tonight and Courtney transferred me to James who is purportedly a supervisor at Walmart.com. He tried to tell me this promotion has ended despite this link being active and showing an expiration or 04/01/17. When i pointed this out, well, the Apple TV doesn't qualify. I've been nice, I've joked, I'm become annoyed; and with him telling me those last two things...now I'm angry. He transferred me to SLING Customer service and PROMISED me they would give me the code and then for me to call VUDU after that was done. Optimistically,  I thought I would be directed to an actual person. NOPE. I'm back in the call queue waiting for the first person to answer. I knew right then and there he was just getting rid of me. \n\nOkay, I just hung up with J.J. from Sling and she confirmed what I know and Walmart.com customer service reps and supervisors don't, they can't help me with this promotion. The link MUST be generated and sent to my email from Walmart.com. How is it possible that I am the only customer not receiving the link and that your customer service reps don't know any details of this promotion and how it works? \n\n8:15 PM - As I'm attempting to suppress my pessimism, I'm trying customer relations one more time tonight \n8:50 PM - I just hung up with Tony, I gave him the information and he's escalating to corporate and says I should receive a phone call withing 3 business days. \n\nBy the way, Sling has outlined the details of the promotion at blog.sling.com. You should have EVERY Walmart.com rep read the details and tell them to stop forwarding customers to them and VUDU.","2016-10-02T00:59:04+0000","159616034235_1295867900447505","walmart",
"I went to our local walmart in Watertown, Wi last week to pick up a 6-pack of mountain dew in 24oz bottles which have been there for over a decade. Suddenly all they have are 16oz bottles. I thought maybe they might be sold out even though the entire shelf was covered in 16oz bottles so I went back the next week to pick one up.\n\nNope, it appears that even though customer service was oblivious (as usual) this store has stopped selling the 24's. This had better not be some lame attempt to start selling healthier when you have an entire aisle of potato chips and 2-3 complete aisles full of candy in addition to your cereal aisle which is nothing more than than flour coated in sugar. My wife has been on me to quit going to Walmart for years but I have argued the prices - namely soda - cheaper. Now that that is gone, she wins. All other local stores carry 24's for $0.50 more, I pay that much in gas to go to Watertown. Congrats, you have made my wife happy, have a nice life and good riddance","2016-10-02T00:24:50+0000","159616034235_10154713359214236","walmart",

"Beware when trying to use the warranty on a Walmart automotive battery.  I took a battery into the Faribault, MN. Walmart that was no longer holding a charge.  It had a 3 year free replacement and a 108 month prorated warranty.  The battery was 85 months old.  The service department ""manager"" checked the battery and determined that it was bad. Labeled on the top of the battery it states it has a 108 month prorated warranty and to keep your receipt.  I had my receipt but the ""manager"" said I did not buy the extended warranty.  I tried to explain to him how a prorated warranty works but he continued to tell me I did not purchase the 108 month warranty.  Walmart needs to better train their ""managers"".  I took the battery and went to Autozone and bought a new battery  from a company that knows what a prorated warranty is.  I am done making a major purchase from Walmart!!","2016-10-01T23:05:14+0000","159616034235_10154713192334236","walmart",

"This morning I visited your Amsterdam Ny location in hopes to purchase some plants. As I walked up the the 50% off rack, where some Mums needed a new home, an employee named Raymond walked over and began to stare at me. I looked back at him and he said ""don't buy those, they are broken and half dead. You don't want that"". I walked away to look at another area. This same employee followed me and as I began looking there he stared at me again. Once again I look at him and he says ""don't buy those, I haven't even watered them yet. It's been three days"". Again I walked away and decided today was not a good plant day. I think maybe your employee Raymond should attempt selling the products instead of just scaring people away.","2016-10-01T17:35:35+0000","159616034235_10154712315574236","walmart",

"I have been seeing a few posts going around about the poor quality of your meat....at first I thought, maybe people are over exaggerating or just trying to stir up drama. Well I got the conformation that your meat is in fact disgusting while I was making dinner for my family of 6. We just moved from Denver to the Provo area this past weekend and we had just started feeling better after catching a stomach bug. This was our first real meal in our new house. I made a sausage, gravy, biscuit casserole (a family favorite). Like usual, I browned the meat, added the gravy, poured it into a glass pan, added the biscuits on top, and cooked it in the oven. When I pulled it out my son, who is almost 7, pointed out that he saw a worm from the side of the see through pan. I thought he was just playing around but decided to check and make sure since I've heard stories of worms being in ""walmart meat"". I put some on an plate and sure enough....there they were. Disgusted, I threw the whole meal away and rushed to the nearest fast food restaurant to pick up dinner for my kids who were then very hungry. I wish I had taken pictures. I wish I had proof of this horrible event. This is NOT ok. This issue needs to be addressed, because stories like this and the ones I've read before about thus very thing will not go unnoticed. I will NOT be buying my meat from Walmart ever again. I know you have billions of customers......but some, like me, will not be quiet and I will be sharing my story where ever I can to make people aware of this happening with your meats.","2016-10-01T07:34:08+0000","159616034235_10154710973869236","walmart",

"Oregon cowboy lassoes attempted bike thief\n\nBy STEVE HARTMAN CBS NEWS September 30, 2016, 7:04 PM\nOregon cowboy lassoes attempted bike thief\n 3 Comments   Share   Tweet   Stumble   Email\nEAGLE POINT, Ore. -- Twenty-eight-year-old Robert Borba is one of the last of a kind; A real, honest-to-goodness, cow roping cowboy.\n\nRobert works at a ranch outside Eagle Point, Oregon. But he recently gained notoriety not for his prowess in the cow corrals, but because of what he did among the cart corrals of a Walmart parking lot.\n\nhartman-otr-hero-cowboy-0930.jpg\nRobert Borba on his horse CBS NEWS\nThis past June, Robert says he moseyed over to the Walmart for some dog food, and on the way out he heard a woman screaming.\n\n“’Stop him! Stop him! He stole my bike! He stole my bike!’ And I kind of look around and all of a sudden this guy goes whizzing by me on a bicycle,” Robert said.\n\nAs security cameras show, there was no way to catch him on foot. So the cowboy did what cowboys do. He saddled up to save the day, armed with little more than a lasso.\n\n“A couple swings and then I threw it at him, just like I would a steer,” Robert said. \n\n“He’s like, ‘What are you doing, man? You got a badge?’ And I’m like, ‘No, I ain’t got a badge,’” he said.\n\nRobert called 911 himself, describing to the incredulous operator how he was able to detain the suspect.\n\n“We got a guy who just stole a bike here at Walmart. I got him roped and tied to a tree,” he said on the call.\n\n“What!?” the operator said.\n\n“I got him roped from a horse and he’s tied to a tree.”\n\nThe cavalry arrived moments later, led by Eagle Point police officer Chris Adams.\n\n“I looked up and from the horse there was a rope connected to the ankle of a gentleman on the ground holding onto a tree,” Adams said.\n\nhorselasso-620lasso91d612e6-4be8-4795-bec4-7e1992b5e331.jpg\nRobert Borba, right with lassoed suspect LAWNS OF MEDFORD\nAt the left in the above photo, you can see the suspect on the ground, roped and tied like steer headed for the pen.\n\nJohn Wayne couldn’t have it done better.\n\n“I’d take him by my side any day,” Adams said.\n\n“I told the cop, I said, ‘Man, you guys ought to pick up a rope and throw that gun away. You might have better luck with it.’ He started laughing,” Robert said.\n\nHe said taking action to stop a thief was just the right thing to do.\n\n“If it was my wife or my little girl, I would hope somebody would help her if I wasn’t around,” he said.\n\nHeroes, like cowboys, are getting harder to find, especially modest ones like Robert, who want absolutely nothing in return.\n\nWhen it was, over police say all Robert asked for was his rope back. He coiled it up, tipped his hat, and then rode off into the sunset.\n\nTo contact On the Road, or to send us a story idea, email us: OnTheRoad@cbsnews.com\n","2016-10-01T02:19:21+0000","159616034235_10210566226941122","walmart",

"Walmart at Clermont Florida abused a disabled veteran and her service dog.  We have gone to this Walmart for over four years when we go to Florida.  I always put my service dog on a folded blanket in the cart.  He is small and has been hit and stepped on by inconsiderate customers.  NEVER in going to this store h as this happened to me.  I was stopped at the door and told I had to carry my dog or walk him in.  He could not ride in the cart.  Neither the door greeter nor the assistant manager on duty could tell me why.  My dog has two years of training and I am not going to get him hurt.  We use a dog stroller through the airports.  I protect him.  I was embarressed and ashamed.  I am a 100% disabled Army veteran and in visits in forty states to Walmart, I have never been told this.  I certainly was not told t his in Feb, May, July, and August when I was at Clermont.  Walmart can do this to me but at the time at this store kids were running through the store, people were opening cosmetics and using them, and the parking lot was a mess.  I would like an explanation as this seems like Walmart is afraid to stop the chaos that can be in the store for fear of being sued or being political incorrect and go after a good customer, an Army veteran, who is doing her best to live with disablities that govern her life.

"To whom it may concern: #WalMart\n\nI write this letter out of aggravation and disappointment. My wife and I recently purchased our first home about a block and a half away from your WalMart location on 3180 South 5600 West, in West Valley City, Utah. Before even moving in, there were two of your shopping carts left on my front lawn. Four days after moving in, a third shopping cart appeared. My wife and I wanted to do the right thing, so even though we didn't personally use those carts, we took on the responsibility of pushing the carts back to your establishment. Over the course of the last year this same situation has repeated itself no less than six more times. This morning, I was greeted by yet another one of your shopping carts left on my lawn. Now I feel I'm a reasonable person and I wholeheartedly understand that these carts aren't being left personally by your establishment or by your employees. I'm sure they're left by carless customers of yours who push their groceries to their homes and are too lazy to bring them back. Now with that understanding, I want to be very clear that operating your business in our fine community is not a right, it's a privilege, and you bear a social responsibility to the citizens living here of having a minimal impact on the community in which you operate. My wife and I have gone to great lengths to make sure we have done everything we can to beautify our home, and to make sure our existence here only causes our community to be continually better, and more beautiful. It is your duty to the citizens in the communities in which you operate, and many of whom are your customers to do the same. Just on my drive home I counted 12 more carts down other streets in my community, in empty fields, and in my neighbor's lawns. Although you can't control all of your customers, or young vandals from stealing carts, what I do expect you to do is either install wheel locks on your carts that will not allow them to keep rolling once they pass a certain point in your parking lot. If you can't do that, than I suggest you have employees do hourly sweeps in a square mile radius around this specific location to retrieve carts from streets, lawns and fields and bring them back to the store. I am open to other suggestions if you have them. Because I know these letters are easily ignored I want you to know that I will be sending this same letter to the specific offending WalMart location to which I am referring, my city council representative, and posting it to my social media accounts. If I don't have a response within a week outlining your plan to resolve this, I plan on taking further action. I appreciate your support in resolving this issue and look forward to hearing back from you.\n\nFrank Mansuetto","2016-10-01T00:48:45+0000","159616034235_10154710256564236","walmart",
"I would like to start out by saying I spend quite a bit of money in your stores every month. That being said, I purchased a Murray 21"" push lawnmower from your Farmerville store. I used this lawnmower about 4 times and that was within the span of around 2, maybe 2 1/2 and the item would not crank. If I actually got it to crank, it immediately died. I was unable to immediately return the lawnmower due to not having someone to load it for me. I went to return the unuseable item today and was told it was only warranted for 90 days. 90 days is ridiculous for an item I paid $200 for. It should last longer than 4 times of use. I saw your sign at the customer service desk about 'customer satisfaction' and I did a sarcastic laugh. I am not a satisfied customer at all! I had purchases to make but I immediately decided then and there that unless I get some 'satisfaction' about this matter, all the money I normally spend at all of your stores can go to stores other than walmart.\n\n And I have complaints about your customer service people who waited on me. I waited patiently in line and when it became my turn I stated my return and presented my receipt. Leanna walked away to find someone to ask because she didn't know what to do. She returned, asked if it had gas in it and stated I couldn't bring it in the store if it had gas in it. She started waiting on others leaving me not knowing what was happening. I asked her 'ok when I empty the gas and bring it back, what do I do?' She said said she was waiting on someone to come and tell her. It would have been nice to have been told that information. Finally after awhile of standing there, Sylvannia shows up and asked about the gas, asked if it was a riding or push mower. I answered her questions. She then asked where it was and I told her the garden section. She walks out of the store like she going to my vehicle and then walks by me back to the service desk and starts waiting on people. I am really livid at that point and she asked Leanna to see if my purchase was more than 90 days and Leanna told her it was 31 days over. Sylvannia said won't take it back. To say the least, I guess I am the wrong color to warrant any decent treatment or consideration. I paid for an item and waited my turn to be waited on. I expected them to take the time out I deserved to find out all the information and give me some answers. I stayed there 30 minutes trying to find out what the procedure was. I warranted enough consideration for them to take the time to provide me with 'customer service' but again I am obviously the wrong color.\n\nAll this being said, I see the American public can no longer expect the quality or service on items purchased at Walmart as they could in the past.","2016-10-01T00:44:56+0000","159616034235_10154710252134236","walmart",

"I was going to get an oil change at the Savoy, Illinois Walmart. I go in line behind a black lady. There was a man taking care of someone at another counter. There was a young black man that I guess was being trained. So he didn't offer to serve us. A woman came asked said ""Hello. What can I do for you?"" The black lady said that she hadn't been served yet. The woman came over to us and looked out into where the men were working. She got on her walkie talkie and said that someone needed to get inside to serve us. I looked at her uniform and it said, I think, ""Assistant Manager"". She went back to the other counter when two men came in. One went out again and she tapped on the window after him and said ""Let's do this now."" He came back in and all four went in through a door. Maybe it was the managers office. In the meantime we waited and waited and waited. I said to the black lady in front of me that we have four employees no serving us. Especially not serving you. I got tired of waiting and left. Walmart had someone that was going to get an oil change and buy some things in your store. \n\nI also want to tell you about the Morristown, TN screw up. I went to get am oil change while passing through on my way home. They not only screwed up and changed my whatever fluid instead. They told me and that is why it took so long. They did give me the oil change for free and I did get the other fluids free. Then I went to Urbana, Illinois and had a lot of oil in my brother's garage under my car. They screwed up the screw up. They did put the plugs in correctly. Urbana did it again for free.\n\nI don't know what I am going to do from now on.","2016-09-30T23:54:18+0000","159616034235_10154710167914236","walmart",

"#Walmart has not satisfied this customer after damaging our truck when we bought a new battery...  \n\n#Walmart A few weeks ago my husband and I went to the Lincolnton, NC Walmart to have a new battery installed in his truck. When we came out and got in the truck (they had left the truck unlocked) I tried to turn on the radio to reset the clock, as it had gotten behind due to the battery. The truck started fine, but the radio/clock wouldn't come on, so we pulled up to the booth and the man told us to pull up to the bay. The service manager Ronnie and the tech came over and opened the hood and said they didn't know why the radio wouldn't come on. It was working fine before. We left and drove maybe 50 yards when I smelled what I thought was an electrical burning smell. We pulled over into a parking lot and got out the manufactures book for the truck and looked up the location of the fuse for the radio, thinking maybe changing the battery had burned up a fuse. My husband pulled open the fuse panel and located the fuse the book had indicated and the fuse looked fine, so he put the panel back and we drove home. He noticed the speedometer, dash lights, gauges and 4 wheeldrive also didn't work. He called Walmart back several times before the service manager talked to him.He said the assistant manager Casey would call us back. The next day he called and I talked to him. He wanted to send us to a local garage to a man he knew to see if he could figure out what was wrong. I told him we wanted to take the truck to a Ford dealership that would have the equipment and codes specifically for a Ford. Casey told me what documentation he needed from the Ford dealership......I gave hime the receipt with documentation. Long story short, We paid a bill from the Ford dealership and they could not fix the radio unless they pulled it out and sent it for testing. They did find a missing fuse for the dashboard problem. Walmart has not reimbursed us for the repair, we still don't have a working radio and it has a CD stuck in it that we were listening to. They are denying our claim. I went to the store 3 times to talk to Casey and never got to talk to him. The first time I went up there I went to the Customer Service desk and asked for Casey and told them my problem. Well one of the women that worked there went off and started talking loudly saying she had taken her car to The Walmart TLE for an oil change and they really messed her car up, she said don't ever take your car there.... now this was an employee, so I thought that was pretty bad. I have talked to them on the phone several times and feel like I was talked down to because I was a woman, even the claims department guy was condescending. All I want is to be reimbursed for the Ford dealership bill and a new radio for the truck. Walmart is usually good when it comes to customer satisfaction. Why am I getting such a bad deal this time. fact is simple.... the truck radio and dash were working fine when we parked it and had a new batery put in and when we got in it to leave, it was Not . rant over for now.\n.","2016-09-30T19:57:15+0000","159616034235_10154709634409236","walmart",

"First off let me say that I love Walmart and love to shop at the stores for everything I need .......BUT.........I want Walmart to know that I am very upset because I purchased a Walmart Money Card today to pay a bill and it turned out to cost me more to use that card!!!!! \n  First of all, I read the back of the package that the card comes in, because Ive never used a prepaid card before, and NO WHERE on the back did it say anything about charging  a $5 service fee to even use the card! When I got home and activated the card only then did I find out about the service fee. So I call the 1-800 number for customer support and I let the lady I spoke to know that I needed to put more money on the card so there would be enough to pay my bill and the $5 service fee that is taken off the card immediantly when used. I then asked her where I could reload money onto the card and shegave me a list of stores I couuld use. HOWEVER.....she didnt say that I  could only put no less than $20 on the card and she failed to mentiion that there would be ANOTHER $3.95 service fee to reload!!!!

"So we ordered a car seat through the site to store website. It has yet to show up though it was scheduled 3 days ago. Nobody can seem to find it. I called Walmart.com only to be told that they can basically stop orders with no communication or notification to the customers because of ""safety reasons"". Basically car seats can be recalled or have defects and they don't have to tell you that you won't be receiving your item, you just get told ""to wait longer"" or ""it's unavailable"". I asked to speak to the person in charge after I was offered a measly 15% refund. I was put on hold only to then be told that your management teams and supervisors for Walmart are ""too busy"" to talk to me. I was then offered 25% and again declined. I was placed back on hold, and then hung up on by your representative. This item was purchased and ordered on Sept. 14, 2016. With plenty of time for it to arrive or for us to be notified of something going wrong. We are now due to have a baby in a few days, and have no car seat because your company can't be bothered with their customers. Your representatives have been nothing but rude and unwilling to help, seeing as its not really your problem. It is not about the money, we want the item we ordered. But apparently Walmart really does not strive for customer happiness, in fact they can't be bothered at all. Way to go Walmart!

"First it was suppose to be a today pick- up (Sept 29,2016) I printed the confirmation ran other errands stopped into that wal-mart which is bit out of my way, went to the pick up it was not there finally I was told to come back to pick up in 15 min the girl and gone to get it. I went back to get it and they did not have any. The manager told me He was billed for them but never received them, well I think I would have tracked that down the minute I got a bill and did not have them!  It tells me I can cancel the order, but it does not take it off your credit card. Will  have to wait to reorder. If I go in it now the website does not show that particular store has them but shows that it will be shipped and available to pick up on Oct 4th, 2016 at 3 stores, including the store I went to and the store closer to me, so why does the  letter below say Oct 13th, 2016 So I am stuck waiting till the credit appears on my charge card so I do not confuse the issue. I called customer service that was a waist of time.there was not anything they could do. Oh and if I do order another I can call them and explain my complaint again! And maybe a discount for my inconvenience. This did not make me feel any better The letter you sent is below\n\nWalmart Customer Care\nHelp Center \n\nHello Nancy,\nThe items shown below are delayed.

"I have never been so disgusted with an online experience in my entire life! I place a large order once a month from walmart as I am disabled and it is hard for me to do long shopping trips. I placed my order as usual and part of my order did not arrive so I contacted customer service, they said it was damaged in shipment and would reship, o.k. no problem. My product did not arrive again, same thing, this happened 4 times, I spent approximately 2 hours online with customer service trying to get 1 product which I never got! I finally had to take a  refund because they said the product was no longer available, a month later. I was never offered a discount, a coupon or any kind of compensation for my trouble.I definitely did not and do not feel like a VALUED customer! If this is how walmart treats all their online customers then they will be losing a lot! They were a lot faster when they were collecting my money!","2016-09-29T22:20:07+0000","159616034235_10154707024719236","walmart",

"Oh walmart.com, how you've failed yet again. I ordered shoes for store pick-up 2 days ago. The pick up was scheduled for yesterday. Instead of getting an email that they were ready yesterday, you email me today cancelling my order as the item was out of stock. Affording me no time to replace them by ordering somewhere else. Again, alerting me 24 hours AFTER chosen day of pick-up. Good to see you have a high level of respect for my time, money, and business. \nI've had issues before with store pickup and items not being available. But honestly, you really just suck. Your customer service and personal responsibility for your items are lacking at best. And the honesty and accurate information you provide is literally nonexistent.

"So frustrated with my local Wal-Mart (Green Bay West). I placed an order online for store pick-up last night. The items are available in-store and my email confirmation said it would be available by 10 am today. By 12:30, I hadn't received confirmation that the order was ready, so I called my local Wal-Mart. After being transferred to the wrong department, I finally get to the order pick-up desk. \n\nShe tells me that they can't find the order number, so I must not have placed it. I was looking at my order confirmation... it was placed. Then, she tells me that the truck with online orders hadn't come in yet. I said this was a same-day pick up, and it shouldn't be waiting for the truck. She said they never pull items from the shelves for an order and that she couldn't do anything for me, so I should call 700-WALMART... which is a Canadian phone number and NOT customer service.\n\nSo I look up the correct phone number and call customer service. They say everything looks in order in their system and the store ""should have pulled the order"" ... as in, pulled it from their shelves. As in not waiting for a truck. As in the local store representative lied to me. So they say they'll call the store and find out what's going on and call me back.\n\nFinally, over an hour and a half after all the phone calls started, I finally get a call saying that it's ready. \n\nI placed the order for pick up because I thought it would be easier than hauling the kids through the store. Man, was I wrong.","2016-09-29T18:57:31+0000","159616034235_10154706399264236","walmart",

"OK I'm going to vent. Went to Wal Marts(that should say it all). Every time I try to use coupons they have changed their rules.Now it's you can use only one coupon for the same product even if you are buying two items and have two coupons.You can't let the cashier ring you up twice and you can't go to a different register.I even had a floor manager look at one of my coupons and tell me I had to mail it in        ( has anyone ever heard of mailing in a coupon).I had to go to the service desk to get the money back for the items that the coupons couldn't be used on(the cashier didn't take all of them off  since I wasn't going to buy them without coupons).I told the service lady that I thought Wal Marts was a pain to deal with.I told her I was venting and she told me she didn't pay any attention when people did that.I told her she needed to at least listen because they are customers.She said she didn't want to get involved,she just wants to pay her bills.I do wonder if she knows that without customers she won't have a job.Saying all of this I'm just going to spend my $200. a week somewhere else.And they no longer price match.","2016-09-29T16:35:20+0000","159616034235_10154706019789236","walmart",

"""Where shopping is a pleasure""...\nI'd say that shopping at your stores is far from that. \nI recently purchased a tv from your website. Pixels have already gone out on the tv. I purchased the three year protection plan that you site offers. \nI have called the protection plan phone number, to which I was told they could not help me. I would have to go through the store. Why would you offer this if they just send you to the store. Their ""customer service"" was far from friendly and helpful. \nI then contact one of the Walmart locations in my area to which I am given the run around, transferred to three different people-all of which have no idea how to help me with my tv situation- I then ask to speak to a manager and am placed on hold for twelve plus minutes until I decide to hang up. I take my tv off of the wall,pack it back into the box in which it came, foam and all and get it into the back of my car and drive up to the local Walmart. \nWhen I asked if someone could help me get a 55 inch flatscreen out of my car, I was told I'd be better off managing on my own as it would be a while for someone to come assist me. \nI haul the tv out of my car and get up to customer service where I'm greeted by a furrowed brow and a scowl of inconvenience. \n\nI am disgusted by the service I receive from this company, and quite frankly, I don't blame your employees. Their paid next to nothing and expected to request state aid in order to feed their families and pay their bills because the CEOs of Walmart are tight wads who won't shell out some more money to pay their employees a decent wage.","2016-09-29T15:23:06+0000","159616034235_10154705826429236","walmart",

"I've contacted Walmart every other way I could think of-the problem originated in speaking with the in-store CSM, I was put on hold using the customer service number, the online chat I tried is apparently useless when dealing with anything other than online orders and the email I sent has gone unanswered. Maybe Posting Here will get someone to pay attention. Either way, it at very least let the company know to be on the lookout for the 2 BBB complaints that are being filed.\n\nI researched the corporate policy about making a non-receipted return the end of the summer because my husband brings home receipts. I knew I had to return some seasonal products that were bought but not needed, and during back to school shopping, we had some pants that didn't fit. I returned the summer stuff and a couple weeks later I returned 2 pairs of pants that didn't fit, and my husband picked out 2 more in their place. The next day I had to return those because the tag on the outside didn't match the actual size on the tag in the pants. It wasn't a big deal, since that was all I would need to return and would complete the 3 returns allowed in a 45 day period. I took in a couple stray cats and sent my husband in a rush to get flea shampoo, collars, kitten food etc. Luckily the strays did not have fleas, so I was going to return 2 of the 3 flea drops he bought since they're $17 each.I didn't think it would be an issue since it has been more than 45 days since I made those returns. The CSM went through the entire prices, slid the return card & scanned it on the register to be loaded, then printed out my return history and said I had met my ""lifetime limit"" then changed that to ""yearly"" when I questioned it. I pointed out that the policy states 45 days and she shrugged and said they haven't updated the system yet. Yet? It looks online like this policy was implemented years ago. I asked a few people about it and had a friend say he was told the same thing, at same store, when he took something back even though he'd only ever made 2 returns and it had been well past the 45 days. He question it though until we talked. He took the same product RIGHT THEN and went talked a different store to see what the system said. told the CSM he just wanted to see his history and they printed it out for him and it showed the return that was ""denied"" as approved! But he didn't leave with the return card. So where did it go? \n\nAt first I just wanted someone to clarify the policy, aND if possible, give me my return as stated on EVERY  stated policy store and online. Now, I want to see my history and find out if it was truly denied, because it seems the CSM at the Austell, GA store might not just be breaking policy, but pocketing return cards. My friend said he will be filing a complaint with the BBB because he doesn't have the time to waste in trying to get something ""so small"" to a big corporation looked in to by the big corporation. I also follow his lead in filing. But in the meantime, I still want answers.","2016-09-29T15:03:02+0000","159616034235_10154705768474236","walmart",

You can visit the store and check out your items at the self-scan counters, or, take your items to one of their friendly associates for check-out.\n\nAlso, you can shop walmart.com while sitting in the comforts of your own home.  My experience with shopping online is you have access to many more great items that some stores might not stock regularly.\n\nOnline prices are reasonable and competitive, and with a minimum purchase of $50.00, shipping is free.

You can also track your purchases and know exactly when they will arrive at your home.\n\nNeedless to say, I love shopping at Walmart!

I was purchasing a 3 pound tube of your ground pork, however when I arrived to the register I noticed the package was open and there was a terrible, rotten smell coming from the meat. I was not disappointed with this as it does happen.\n\n However, I was extremely disappointed with how the manager handled the problem. The girl who was working my register, LaQuasha, was extremely nice and apologized for the problem with the ground pork. She offered to get it replaced but I declined  and continued to apologize.   When her manager came by, who was not really doing too much, she asked her what she should do with the smelly rotting meat.  instead of being helpful, her manager told her that she needed to double bag it leave it at the register/her work station, continue her tasks, and the next time that she had free, LaQuasha herself, needed to take the meat to customer service and do some sort of store claim with it.  As a customer, I was extremely disappointed with how the manager not only handled the rotting meat situation but also her treatment towards a really good employee. Instead of being helpful and taking a situation that was gross and handling it, she just chose to leave it there with the cashier. \n\nI feel as though someone should be made aware of this within your corporation. Employee treatment and morale is crucial for Walmart to provide excellent guest service while also maintaining an efficient and happy employee environment. The treatment of LaQuasha today was extremely unnecessary and disappointing.  Her supervisor should be a facilitator to help her do her job the best that she can and troubleshoot tough situations for her. Instead she was met with a patronizing attitude and aloofness.","2016-09-29T13:37:33+0000","159616034235_10154705545099236","walmart",
"I have posted about this before but I am having the problem again. I have a prepaid Walmart card and direct deposit on to that card. I depend on receiving that money when Walmart advertised I could have. I am all used to having it on that day, so I have come to rely on it. Lately Walmart has had trouble coming through and that's not fair to me the consumer. You shouldn't advertise something you're not going to do. Now they say there is a delay in direct deposits, that I should just keep looking for it???!!! That's really nice ...","2016-09-29T13:36:13+0000","159616034235_10154705543324236","walmart",

"So I wrote a post about a frustrating visit to one of your stores. The problem I have isn't a store level problem. It's a company problem. It's that every time i visit one of your stores doesn't matter which it's usually the same problem. There are never any cashiers and to actually help, but there are definitely a group of people available to watch self check out. Why would I want to ring myself up? Like why? Making through your stores are already annoying enough. Honestly don't blame your employees for not being helpful on what you guys pay. Your company cost taxpayers 6.2 billion dollars in government assistance benefits. That's outrages considering what kind of profit you guys bring.","2016-09-29T12:52:58+0000","159616034235_10154705441179236","walmart",

"So tonight, my fiance and I went to the walmart on hull street rd at chattanooga plaza in Midlothian Va. We were buying a bunch of things for our new house, which we are moving into tomorrow. We had two carts that were both  completely filled, and we spent almost  $800 dollars. The guy who was ringing us up was named Corey, and he was awesome. Very friendly. When my fiance and I got the total, we were going to split it down the middle and each of us pay for half. When she swiped her card, she was charged the entire ammount onto just her card. Corey was very apologetic and went to get help to fix the issue. It was an honest mistake, he went to get his manager, so far so good. The manager that arrived was clearly training. I didnt get his name but he was also very nice and wanted to help us. However he was not sure what to do so he called his training manager, her name was Tammy. Tammy had been sitting at the customer service center right in front of us the whole time with another employee. When he first asked for help, she quickly said ""void it and ring it all up again"" and went back to talking to her friend. My fiance asked how long it would take for the money to go back to her card, the manager that was training was not sure so he looked over and called Tammy. Before he could ask her the question she snapped back and said ""I am on lunch!"" We all were somewhat stunned. He said ""She just wanted to know..."" when she cuts him off again and says ""I said I am on lunch. If you need help go get someone else!"". Now remember, its not like this was something we heard through a door. She was looking right at all of us. \n\nOkay so a couple of things...\n1) we just spent almost $800 dollars in your store, are you telling me you can't take 5 minutes to help fix a simple and honest mistake?\n2) no training manager should speak to someone they are training like that. No manager should speak to their employees like that ever. It was disrespectful and unprofessional.\n3) if youre on your lunch and dont want to be bothered, go to the break room. Thats what it is there for. Dont sit at the front of the store where everyone can see you. \n\nWe will not be going back to this location again, if we ever do go back to walmart at all.","2016-09-29T03:49:39+0000","159616034235_10154704373284236","walmart",

They informed that the supposedly oil change I had paid for a week before was in fact not done correctly and on top of that the oil cap was not replaced and had cause oil to spill to the engine thus causing the smoke/burning smell.

"Good evening!  So often people use social media to express their dissatisfaction with corporations, so I thought I’d take a minute to express my gratitude.  Last Wednesday (9/21) I wrote an email to Walmart reaching out for support with a customer service issue after unsuccessful attempts at resolving the issue over the phone with Customer Service – I had ordered my twin boys personalized Wiggles t-shirts for an upcoming concert, but I received them both with the same name.\n\nI felt it was important to follow up to express our family’s extreme gratitude for how seriously Walmart took our situation, and to the extent that your associates took to ensure our situation was resolved.  Your Philadelphia Regional Manager, Bhupit Bohra, took it upon himself to personally take on our situation, find a resolution, and follow through until it was resolved. He ensured our order was reprinted and expedited, and when an unexpected FedEx delay further compounded the situation, he found a local printer to create the shirts just so my boys wouldn’t be disappointed on their special day.\n\nWhile one single transaction won’t ever make or break an international company with billions in sales per year such as Walmart, it was beyond impressive how much your company cared about our one single situation, and how Mr. Bohra personally followed through to ensure it was resolved. Walmart and Mr. Bohra treated us better, and provided a higher level of service, than we have ever experienced within any retail establishment we have ever patronized.\n\nI wanted to take a moment to commend Mr. Bohra for his support and care during this situation. The Philadelphia market is certainly lucky to have a leader such as him supporting the stores in his region.  Lastly, it is commendable how far Walmart Executive relations and Mr. Bohra went to support our family and correct this situation. You have made us reevaluate our retail shopping choices, and will continue to devote our shopping dollars to Walmart and Sam’s Club in the future. Thank you again for your excellent customer service, and to Mr. Bohra for saving the day for our family.","2016-09-29T01:15:59+0000","159616034235_10154704148754236","walmart",

"I have thinking to my self that I should not complain about this but I had the worst experience at the Chester va walmart. I don't normally shop here but I had run out of tulle for a project I was working on. I stopped in with my 3 kids and husband and found the tulle. Great! But I decided to browse and see if they had any good clearence items. While looking we found two ninja turtle costumes the were 5 bucks each.  That was just perfect for us because costumes are super expensive right now and it hard to find a pair of matching costumes that don't break the budget for twins. We put them in the basket and proceeded to out and my boys were excited. We went to self  check out because it has the shortest line we scanned all items but the costumes rung up as 15 each. We called for a and explained to her where found them and the price we saw them for. She was unsure how to handle the situation so she called a manger who proceeded to argue with me and my husband about the price. Saying that there can't be any costumes on clearence because they just got all the Halloween stuff in last week. I told her what  I saw and told the attendant I could show her the price and where I saw the items. So I took her over there  and wouldn't you , I was actually right. She looked it over and said she would tell the manger and they would give me the items at the 5 buck price. While walking back we saw the manager and the attendant told me she wanted to show the her where the items were. So I went back to my checkout line  and headed off with the manager. We waited a while and they finally came back. The manager told me someone put the items in the wrong place and that  she would not give them to me for that price.she   was rude and  belligerent and said"" do you want them or not"". I asked her for what price and she said  15 bucks. I told her no and she grabbed them from my sons which made them cry hysterically.  So my boys dad and were angry over the horrible Customer service we received and this whole process to forever.

What, you have got to be kidding me.  Then I read about the store managers rote reply that came across very phony and WalMart's apparent refusal to discipline the employees makes it even worse.  Your company is despicable!  My wife and I shop at WalMart regularly or let me rephrase that USED to shop at WalMart regularly.  I will never spend another penny at your business.  I truly hope that every WalMart store that calls for a police response is refused and the cops advise that having a officer wearing blue respond to a WalMart may be considered racist.

"TayLor Wilkes\n23 September at 01:27 · Fairburn, GA · \n#BOYCOTTWALMART: So my buddy's sister went to Walmart in McDonough, GA to have a cake made for their father's retirement party. He's retiring from being a police officer. She asked Walmart to make a ""thin blue line"" cake to commemorate his extensive and honorable service as a dedicated police officer. Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being ""racist."" Three separate people in management denied her request for this reason. To me, this is appalling. There is nothing racist about the symbolism behind the ""thin blue line,"" yet people CHOOSE to make EVERYTHING about race. I'm so tired of it. It's literally exhausting for me to think about now. It's only ignorant people who continue to spread this negativity. People need to educate themselves. Bottom line. I'm just waiting for the day that our American flag is deemed ""racist"" by ignorant instigators who are just looking for attention and for something to be upset about.

"It is kind of strange that Walmart cannot honor their own advertised prices. Very conveniently cite site error and offer a refund instead of fulfilling the accepted order. Recently place an order online at walmart.com for Dove box of shareable size candy bars box of 12 advertised for $1.76. Too good a deal to pass so I placed order for 3 boxes. When I go to store to pickup order, to my surprise I see only 3 candy bars instead of 12. Store conveniently says that's online so talk to walmart.com customer service. Call customer service they say talk to store. Easy gaming consumers and kicking them around. Finally CS agreed it was a site error and said all they can do is issue a refund. Who wants the refund? Fulfil the committment made online when the price was advertised with the description as box of 12. Guess this is first time for me, but I assume there are many who are in the same boat.

"Dear Walmart:\n\nI have recently had the unfortunate necessity of searching for sympathy cards related to pregnancy loss, and I have noticed that these types of cards are virtually non existent in your stores. I urge you to please look into getting a large selection of cards for miscarriage and pregnancy loss as these situations are the ones where words often fail us and we need cards like these to get our thoughts and emotions to the families in need. Not having these cards specific to the situation can leave a family and friends feeling lost and isolated, and it's not fair. I strongly urge you to look into expanding your sympathy cards selection for miscarriage and pregnancy loss so these families can truly experience the love and hope their friends and families want them to have during this horrible time.","2016-09-28T20:59:49+0000","159616034235_10154703699014236","walmart",

"I placed an order on Sept 22 for an on sale item on Walmart.com. The item was Clearly marked ""Pack of 12"" on the website and on my confirmation e mail. My payment method was accepted and all steps were followed. 5 days later I got an e mail that my order was ready for pick up. I drove the 10 miles to the store. When I got to the store they attempted to pass off a single item From the ""Pack of 12"" that I ordered, to inaccurately fulfill my order. The store employee contacted Walmart.com and was told that there was a mistake made on the website. They said the ""Only thing they could do was to give me a refund"". If a mistake was made, why did Walmart.com send me a confirmation e mail that Clearly shows ""Pack of 12""? And 5 days later, a pick up order that Clearly shows ""Pack of 12"" is ready for pick up? Then try to pass off a single item (1 of 12) as my confirmed order? And tell me that their record shows 1 of 1? If they knew that there was a mistake made. Why did they not send me an e mail explaining that? Instead of Falsely informing me that my order was ready for pick up, as ordered? My claims are as follows; Possible False Advertising. Walmart.com Failed to honor a sale price. Walmart.com Failed to accurately fulfill my order as it was Clearly stated on my confirmation documents from them. Walmart.com may have provided possible False and or Misleading statements on my pick up order e mail to get me to drive the 10 miles to the store in hopes that I would spend money while I was there. Rather than waste a trip. The above will be include in my report to the Better Business Bureau. This could have been avoided if I was informed of any Alleged ""mistakes"" on their website before making me go out of my way to drive to the store then have them attempt to fulfill my order with something other than what I ordered.","2016-09-28T20:27:53+0000","159616034235_10154703585919236","walmart",

"I placed an order for 4 36 packs of an item, and instead they sent 4 single items. I traveled all the way to the store to pick my order up, and it was wrong. The store was more than willing to fix the issue, but the don't carry the 36 packs in store. I was told to call customer care to request a replacement order. When I called, I was told that since it was out of stock they could not send a replacement order. I then asked to speak with a manager and was put on hold for a half hour. When she FINALLY was transferring me to a manager she hung up on me. So I called back and spoke with someone else that ALSO hung up on me. When I called back a third time I was furious, he transferred me to a manager that said she would NOT honor the price for the 36 pack and would only give me a refund and a $10 gift card for my time. This is extremely disrespectful. I get paid more than that at work and I had wasted 2 hours of my time by then. If you knew you didn't have the correct item, then why didn't you just cancel my order instead of wasting my time. I then asked for the managers manager that told me the same thing and I told her that I would be filing a BBB complaint because this is ridiculous. Not only have I been treated terribly, I've also been disrespected, and I still don't even know that I'm getting my money back. After I got off the phone with her, I got an email saying that my order had been picked up, which is NOT correct. You have now lost a customer, and you have a BBB complaint to follow up on. You should be ashamed of yourself that you do business this way. Your customer service is absolutely HORRIFIC!","2016-09-28T13:34:41+0000","159616034235_10154702372379236","walmart",

"Yesterday (9/26) was my daughter Mels birthday...All Mel has said for WEEKS is that she wants a Pepa Pig cake! My aunt called all around and Walmart was the only place to carry a Pepa Pig kit...so she ordered Mel the cake! She went and got the cake tonight and brought it over so we could sing to Mel and she could blow out her candles! SOOOO, The cake gets here and my aunt tells me to come look at it and asked me what I thought was on the cake....I could not believe that this cake had hairs on the top of it! Like human hairs! SOOOO, I call Walmart and ask to speak to a manager and this girl gets on the phone and I explain, very nicely, that we got a cake for my daughter and it has hair on the top...She asks me how we didn't notice it before we left the store...I told her we were in a hurry, but explained that the sticker they put on still had the box sealed...She proceeds to tell me to take a picture of this cake and bring the picture in tomorrow and she will see what they can do for us...I tell her it's my daughters birthday today and I'm just upset that the cake we ordered has obvious hairs on it and she just gets really rude and disrespectful! So I tell her fine, forget it...she doesn't need to be rude to me and I will never buy a cake there again and I hang up...I got crabby, yes! Because I'm trying to explain this situation and how nasty it is and she is just being down right nasty to me! So, I get off the phone\n..go inside and explain to my daughter she can't have her cake...She's crying and wants to just have her ice cream so we give her the ice cream and decide to take the cake back to Walmart. We go in and go up to the service desk and the CSM apologized and called for a specific manager because I didn't want to speak to the previous one I spoke to on the phone because I probably would have thrown the cake in her face...So this other assistant manager is trying to basically tell this CSM on the phone he knows who I am, because of the phone call with the other Mgr, and he doesn't want to come out...he finally agrees to come see me and when he gets there I explain to him I am by no means a rude person or hateful, im.upset because of how this girl spoke to me and refused to fix this problem...he tells me he can not go above a manager who is the same rank as him and make a decision on this situation...I tell him all I am asking for is a refund for this cake with hair...NOPE! The CSM even said, ""can we just refund the money for the cake""....NOPE! so I tell him at this point I'll gladly talk to the girl I spoke to on the phone, because I'm not sure what decision he is ""over riding"" because she told me to bring in a picture of the cake tomorrow and I was NOT feeding this cake to my kids....He ends up going into the office and the CSM comes out a min later and refunds us the money and apologized several times for the cake and the behavior of the managers....The manager never once said sorry, NEITHER OF THEM, and neither came back out while I was still there. All I can say is I am so embarrassed for that store. The way it has been run since Bob passed is an absolute disgrace! I will NEVER again do business with Walmart Bakery in Pekin!","2016-09-28T03:10:38+0000","159616034235_10154701164459236","walmart",

The women in the optical department Ruth, Hahn, and others were also very helpful.\n\nIn a turn of fate, by calling my phone, my wallet was found at a nearby bus station and I arranged a meet up nearby with the good Samaritan with everything still in the wallet and with my keys.

I looked where they usually keep them but the didn't have them so I asked the lady that was stocking the shelves and she said.  We aren't carrying them this time of the year it will be next spring before we start again.  Now I could understand this except that they had a complete huge display in the middle of the produce department, right by the bakery, of strawberries to sell where they usually place the dessert cup cakes to sell with them.

"Hello, I went to walmart yesterday and bought Coconut water - ""Vita Coco"". After drinking the water I got really sick and then when I checked the expiration date it said that it was expired since march of 2011. This is absurd, how can a product that was produced to be expired in 2011 is still on the shells in the supermarket. Thats a major issue! I had to go to the hospital to get medication for my intestine after getting really sick. If it was any other food such as meet, cereals, fish etc, it could have developed to an infection. I can not express my in satisfaction and current distrust with Walmart. Additionally I would like to ask for Walmart to take those bottles away from he shelf before anyone else drinks it.\n Ps.

Can you please tell me what you think of this manager of yours.\n\nDavid the department manager when I requested to speak to him, sent a message thru the lady that returned my requst to speak to the pharmacy  department manager.  Evidently he could not be bothered to return my phone call.  Or even a request to speak with him when the call was returned it took 3 requsts to speak with him.  Then he acted as though it was a bother to speak to me and when i asked about the 3 pack of 1.75 glasses, David stated that walmart did not offer those in a 3 pack on his inventory order form.  That is strange to me since i have purchased them at this walmart within the last 18 months.  I further requested that he check and find out why he was not offered this item and he offered no responce to my requset.  This to me is a total failure of responsibility for the position that he holds.  As a customer how can i have any confidence in this man or this store to carry the items that I  need.  I  should find another store such as HEB to do my shopping and will have to travel to Corpus Christi  or San Antonio to shop for the other items that i may need.\n\nSincerely \n\nMatthew Kimble","2016-09-27T18:55:33+0000","159616034235_10154700117494236","walmart",

"I hope some people lost their jobs because of the following. Why are they BLM supporters and still working at Walmart. Walmart is definitely not the store that Sam built.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo my buddy's sister went to Walmart in McDonough, GA to have a cake made for their father's retirement party. He's retiring from being a police officer. She asked Walmart to make a ""thin blue line"" cake to commemorate his extensive and honorable service as a dedicated police officer. Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being ""racist."" Three separate people in management denied her request for this reason. To me, this is appalling. There is nothing racist about the symbolism behind the ""thin blue line,"" yet people CHOOSE to make EVERYTHING about race. I'm so tired of it. It's literally exhausting for me to think about now. It's only ignorant people who continue to spread this negativity. People need to educate themselves. Bottom line. I'm just waiting for the day that our American flag is deemed ""racist"" by ignorant instigators who are just looking for attention and for something to be upset about.

"Concerning the McDonough, Georgia store, where the employees refused to bake a cake because it would've required them to put ""blue lives matter"" on it. I don't believe that Walmart is doing enough to circumvent this problem, as it appears to be something you deal with on an individual basis, instead of ensuring that all of your employees, nationwide, understand, that advocating and protesting private citizens/customers, while at work in your stores, will not ever be tolerated, and will result in immediate dismissal of any and all employees who even attempt this kind of thing, irregardless of their past work history at your company. The workplace is not the place to protest social issues like this, especially since this symbol has not been placed on any governmental list of ""racist"" symbology. Your employees haven't any right to refuse this service to a customer, not based on some flimsy excuse as ""their conscious"" not permitting them to perform this service. As far as I am concerned, this is a form of harassment and discrimination against some of your customers, that you are deliberately permitting  to go on in the ranks of your employees, perhaps as it may be some kind of philosophy at the corporate level, as well. I have begun advocating that all of your customers who do not follow your apparent corporate police of harassment and discrimination of private customers, those of whom you permit this kind of harassment and discrimination of service to, boycott your stores, as this must not be permitted to become part of our national treatment of the citizens, whom without, you would have no business.","2016-09-27T17:08:46+0000","159616034235_10154699883379236","walmart",

Today was not a good day for her, but I took a chance and brought her to Walmart with me. She had a pretty bad meltdown and I'm not sure what triggered it, but as soon as it started, I was making my way out from the electronics section when a man came up to me, smirking and told me he would let me borrow a belt to use on her. \n\nIll be honest, I did not handle this well at all. \n\nYour employee Natasha came over to us and asked if I was ok. She saw the whole thing and told me what he did was not right, asked if there was anything she could do to help and gave me a big hug.  she was very sympathetic and caring and I'm really grateful. \n\nThank you for having great employees. ♥️","2016-09-27T17:04:18+0000","159616034235_10154699867594236","walmart",
"I am a big online shopper and use Wal-Mart.com frequently. However, y'all are making it harder and harder to use without a bunch of stress and hassle. I ordered my daughter an emoji bean bag chair for her upcoming birthday (along with some other birthday and Halloween items). It arrived today in a box with no packing slip, no plastic over it, just in the box. It has little stains all over it and even what looks like mulch and the zipper is broken. It looks like they took something from a daycare yard sale and threw it in the box for me. I call to send it back and get a replacement, and apparently I cannot do this (Although the woman I spoke with was incredibly nice and apologetic). Because my order of $180 something was paid with a $12 gift card from my savings catcher account and the rest was on my bank card, I instead have to go through the hassle of returning it to the store, waiting for the refund to be processed, and then reordering and hoping it will be here in time for her birthday. All because someone could not see that this item was NOT in new condition and packed it haphazardly. I shop online for a reason and should be able to send the item back and have it exchanged without having to go through this whole hassle because of your employees mistake.","2016-09-27T16:54:20+0000","159616034235_10154699846264236","walmart",

I went and sat down and was getting ready to nurse when the lady at the counter rushed over and in a very loud voice told me I couldn't nurse there and I could go to the bathroom and nurse or leave. She actually told me that! I couldn't believe it, I should not have to nurse in a bathroom there are so many germs and you guys no offense but don't keep the bathrooms very clean. If it's not ok to nurse in your stores you should put a sign on the doors to tell mom so they make sure not to shop there just in case they do end up needing to nurse while shopping for groceries.

"So, I've ordered a quite a lot of stuff for Site-To-Store... but now things have changed.  When I order something now, I""m shown the expected delivery date.  But after I submit the order, I get a much different estimated delivery date or a range of dates.  I ordered a simple audio cable but a length that you won't stock in stores.  When I was entering the order, the date was 9/22.  After I submit it and get the order confirmation, it now says 9/22 to 9/26...

"Hi, I saw a few items from your San Jose, Ca and Salinas, Ca Walmart stores that were lower in prices. Thinking it was okay to do a price match right after work I went out of my way to drive to the Marina, Ca Walmart store to price those items and because there were other items that that I bought during this time to make up for what I thought was going to save from the items I was price matching..As I was checking out the CSM said I couldn't price match the items that were lower in prices from another Walmart store. She scanned the item and obviously it's that store's scanner it would it's own price on it and NOT the one from another store. Now, that doesn't make sense at all...if i were price matching from Target and she scanned the item wouldn't it show the price from that Walmart and not the sale price from Target? She also said that if I do price match that I would only be allowed to price match 1 thing...that also doesn't make sense...I have a big family and that's the point of me price matching..if I find an item that's a good deal I would buy as much as I can afford plus it doesn't really make sense for me to drive 10 miles just to get 1 item...I was at the Salinas, Ca Walmart the other day and I purchased an item that was lower than the price at the Marina, Ca store...I live in Carmel, Ca and When I used that item I liked it so I decided to go to Marina to price match the item and apparently they couldn't price match another store that is also Walmart?!?! Please, give me a clear explanation about price matching in your branch stores because there are a bunch of us people who are struggling..families that are trying to find ways to save money that are getting frustrated about this whole ""price matching"" you advertised because it seems to me it's just a false advertisement that might need some class action.We get embarrassed when we are called scammers at check out when are only trying to save money. Price matching to me should be from competing stores and online stores including its own branch stores. Please, take a look at your Price matching policy again...I will be waiting for your response.","2016-09-27T14:15:06+0000","159616034235_10154699479974236","walmart",

I understand voicing your complaints and I agree The employees can be quite rude and unconcerned with your shopping experience. It's the day we live in. The youth generation never learned compassion, empathy and consideration.  We just have to tolerate it. They act like we (the consumer) are in their way.

"Came to this location to buy a VIZIO D65 TV (UPC# 84522604340) where the tag shows the price of $798 but it rang up for $398 which is the reason why I wanted to buy it. Terry (manager) first rang it to check the price and advised me to head up front to check out. Then Elias (customer service manager) started looking to see if the tag matched the tv and I proved that it did match by showing the model number on both the tag and tv. He took the tag and rang it to double check to see if it rang up and he saw the $398 price and started saying that we can't sell it to me. Another manager came (didn't see her name) she said there was a glitch in the system but was on a 4K tv. She left and so did Elias. Elias came back with Javier (Assistant Manager) came stating that he cannot ""honor the price it rang up for"" I advised that if that's what the tv rang up for then he has to honor it. I then says that it's a glitch. I was beyond pissed to hear that. He then argues with me in front of customers claiming that he cannot honor the price.

I drop paiten off at dance and go to Walmart to get some groceries. As usual it's packed and there is maybe 5 lanes open all together with lines out in the main aisles. I have been standing in this line for about 15 minutes and finally get the put my stuff up on the counter. As the lady finishes the man in front of me I keep putting my stuff up and am standing there when she looks at me and says my light is off you have to go to another lane. I said excuse me I've been in this line when the light was on for at least 15 minutes! She says well I was supposed to go home 15 minutes ago I'm leaving, I said mam I'm clearly a nurse (in scrubs) I NEVER get to go home when it's ""time to get off"" but do you think I tell my patients they have to come another time or see someone else because I'm going home? She just looks at me as she starts away. So if you heard the crazy woman in Walmart today, that was ME!! 🙋🏼 I understand she wanted to go home but she could've finished her line.

"On September 13th, I purchased an item on walmart.com that was supposed to be a same day store pick up.  When I ordered it, the site said it was available in the store.  I was buying the item as a gift and wanted to pick up the item right away.  I waited a couple of hours and called the store to find out if the item was ready to be picked up.  I was told that the order was declined because they didn't have it at the store.  I was not given the option of picking up at another store nor was I given the option of getting an immediate credit or refund so I could buy the item and pay in store as I was told I would have to do in order to get it that night. On 9/13, when I was told I couldn't get the item that night, I went online to cancel the order AND called walmart.com to see if this order was cancelled.  I was told a cancellation would be ""processed"" and that the refund had been requested.  On 9/20, I called walmart.com only to be told that it took 24-48 hours for my refund to be processed and approved and that my 3-5 business day wait started on that day.  Then on 9/22 I get an email that states the item that I had order has been shipped and received at the store.  By this time, I had tried to cancel the order THREE (3) times AND requested a refund at least twice.  I called walmart.com AGAIN, only to be told the refund had been requested but had not been processed. I would get my refund in 3-5 day.  Here is ts 9/26 and I get a call from a walmart store employee asking if I wanted the item.  Why was he not informed that I had cancelled and had requested a refund?  This is totally ridiculous and a great inconvenience to the customer.

The orders were confirmed at multiple locations and show as ready for pickup.  Upon driving over an hour to the first location, we were handed a single arrow. (Although online it clearly shows pack of 12).  We were informed that it was an online glitch that Walmart.com was aware of.  We simply wasted an entire day dealing with orders we weren't able to get.  Miraculously, the product is still listed on Walmart's website now, over 48 hours later at the same price.  Great job taking care of your customer Walmart.","2016-09-26T23:29:43+0000","159616034235_10154697898329236","walmart",

"So this morning I went to Walmart to send a money gram and while I was at the counter, I started sweating profusely, feeling weak all over and then everything started fading to black.... The cashier asked if I was okay and said that I had gone white as a ghost... Thankfully I was next to a bench that I fell over onto before I could truly pass out. The manager ran and grabbed me a candy bar & an OJ, kept me awake long enough for me to get something down, and checked on me until I started to feel better. Not sure if it was my blood sugar or my blood pressure or both but I couldn't be anymore grateful to have had people act when I needed help, instead of pulling their phones out to record me, ignore me or something stupid you hear about people doing all the time. I was absolutely terrified for me and my baby because I've never had anything like that happen but the staff at Walmart were an absolute blessing. When I tried to pay for the food - the cashier said absolutely not honey, that's on me. 😭 But baby Ryder has been kicking up a storm today and I'm feeling okay since I ate & napped... I just won't be skipping breakfast again anytime soon! ❤️","2016-09-26T23:04:01+0000","159616034235_10154697857604236","walmart",
"What does it take for Walmart to honor their sale of merchandise after taking a customers money? My purchase was denied under the lie that the store didn't have the items. When in fact the store manager William (aka:Billy) removed all the items from the shelves & stated ""Call this corporate number, it's not my problem."" Wheather it was a type-o or not, once the took my money from my bank and confirmed my purchase the sale was complete & I am due my purchased merchandise. I was treated rudely and by a manager of your corporation & later sent an email stating that ""We're sorry you didn't pick up you merchandise & we are processing a refund of your purchase price."" I did not fail to pick up my merchandise & still want my purchased items. As of this writing, ""No"" money has been returned to my account! What ever happened to a company (i.e. Walmart) standing behind their bond of a sale to a customer? I'm thoroughly angered at the practice of the unprofessional management staff member at the ""Aberdeen MD. Walmart"". I have attempted to contact the 800 number for the customer service that was thrown at me on a blank card but have been placed on hold waiting for someone to pick up, but no one ever does. I would appreciate a contact number to a real person to resolve this issue, because it has severely affected my future business with your corporation!\n\nRespectfully,\nMike McDowell","2016-09-26T22:56:01+0000","159616034235_10154697845649236","walmart",

"Walmart--\nI have to express my deep disappointment in your services lately.  I ordered a water slide, very expensive, this past summer.  Your warehouse shipped it WITHOUT the air pump!!!  So we had to return it and it was one heck of a return process, nothing easy I assure you.  Actually, so completely stressful that I chose NOT to reorder!--a loss of a 460 dollar sale for Walmart....\nToday, I decide to try again for some baby equipment I needed.  I ordered online, chose pick up in store, and I get no confirmation that its ready.  I call the store, mind you its been more than a few hours.  The store pick up area tells me its paid for but someone needs to put it in a bin for it to be released.  So I asked if I could just literally get it myself, since I paid for it.  He tells me NO!  He tells me NO...  I paid for it.  He then tells me when the person has it in this bin he'll let me know, but the person just got to work at 3:00.  Mind you my email states it will be ready by 2:19.  \nSo really, pick up in store, is not a possibility because the store isn't going to try to get the item ready in that 4 hour time period it states on your website.  Meaning pick up in store is not a quality option either.  \nI can't ship items because your warehouse is not trustworthy, and I can't use the online pick up in store option because its really not a functional option.  \nSo farewell Walmart--I'm done with your lackluster poor quality service.","2016-09-26T22:14:27+0000","159616034235_10154697717384236","walmart",

"I really have to start shopping at target. Walmart really makes customers work for their patronage. I was there not\nLong ago. I wasn't shopping at my normal location so several times I had to ask for direction. Several times I was just pointed in a general direction. Once I got lost again and just immediately gave up looking for what I wanted. I didn't think I needed a buggy, but I was mistaken. I had too many items and they began to fall from my hands. Not only did a group of employees walk pass me as I struggled. There was of course only one line that had an actual cashier, and the line was insane. The only other option was self check out where another group of employees are paid to stand and watch me try to figure out the plu# for my Roma tomatoes. Once I finally made it through ringing my groceries and I wanted to insert my cash I was told by one of the cashiers that was paid to watch me that the machine I was using only took cash. I have never worked so hard to buy groceries. I feel as if you owe me money for the labor I put in on that trip. Seriously, I don't want to come to a store to ring up my own items. Why not just hire enough cashiers and actually pay them a decent wage! Goodness knows you're definitely bringing in the profit to do so. The level of greed with this company is unreal. You guys have the most employees on government assistance yet you're one of the largest companies.

Tell you what, since you don't support them when someone wants to come spend money on them, how about you stop supporting them when a robbery happens or how about not employing them on Black Friday, or the next time you get a shoplifter handle it yourself instead of calling the cops.

"I picked up two sandwich platters from your New Lenox, Il location for a party I had on Saturday (9/24). When I got home, I realized I wasn't charged for the second one which was $18. \n\nI made a special trip there today to pay for the platter. I didn't have a lot of time since I had to pick my son up from preschool and I walked in and the line for customer service was at least 8 people deep with one woman working. No less than three employees walked over there not looking like they were doing anything in particular, yet none of them jumped on a register to help. Finally, someone came over to help and the line got moving. I got up there and explained what happened and the woman told me the I had to go and get a UPC code from the deli (on the opposite end of the store) because she didn't have that. If I'm not mistaken, isn't that what the phone/intercom/walkie talkie system is for? So customer service sent a pregnant woman all the way to the opposite side of the store to get a UPC code. She didn't even offer for me to go to the front of the line when I got back. \n\nI was literally just at one of your competitor's stores right before this and during checkout there was no barcode on an item. Did they send me back to the aisle to find it? No. The manager radioed back to someone to go find the item and read her the code. It took all of one minute. I would assume the deli would have been even easier as I'm sure they have an actual phone on the wall back there. \n\nSo, I rushed over to the other side of the store (I should have just left) and waited patiently for my turn at the deli. The woman at the deli was very nice and gave me the code. I wasn't about to go all the way back to customer service to pay so I looked for an express checkout lane. The ""express"" checkout lane was probably 10 people deep and there were only a couple of regular registers open. So, I waited some more so that I could pay your store money for something that they forgot to charge me for two days ago. I was fuming at that point, but didn't have time to go and complain to a manager because by this time I had spent at least 20 minutes in the store and I had to go get my son. This is just more validation for me as to why I only go to your store if it's absolutely necessary.","2016-09-26T18:44:36+0000","159616034235_10154697143159236","walmart",

"WalMart CEO, Mr. Doug McMillon, I have a question for you.  What would Sam Walton think?  When he founded his first store do you believe he would allow his employees to refuse service to customers based on their jobs?  Do you think he would, for a moment, hesitate to serve a fireman, a teacher, a ditch digger, or a police officer because of their function in society?\n\nIf so, I have misunderstood the integrity and customer service platitudes outlined by Mr. Walton.  If not, why is your corporation allowing employees to refuse simple services to police officers based on their careers?  Additionally, if you support this behavior may I suggest you put up signs advising officers to stay out.  That you will handle disputes, assaults, shoplifters, shootings, oh, and Black Friday on your own . . . no need for those sub-human police officers.\n\nUntil I hear otherwise, I will choose to respect and support the police who are standing by to come should I ever need them.  I just cancelled my lastest WalMart Online order and will be driving twenty miles the other way from my neighborhood WalMart to a Target store.  I encourage all who find WalMart's lack of response to these incidents to take similar actions.\n\nI await your response, Mr. McMillon.\n\nA greatly disappointed long-time customer,\n- B.A. Batten\nMaster Police Officer, retired","2016-09-26T18:15:09+0000","159616034235_10154697071889236","walmart",

"I have to say in clear words that I abhor the CORPORATION that is WALMART! It is rare (say once or twice a year, so my opinion as a consumer will fall on deaf ears) that I ever step foot in one of your stores or purchase a product through your website. I always leave your business with a sour taste in my mouth. I went into one of your stores today to purchase a ink cartilage. It was a immediately needed item, That is the only reason I went. What was presented in an anti-theft box marked ""return to pharmacy"" in the entertainment department was believed to be a $14.97 item, but no, Walmart needs more money, and it rang up $24.97. As I waited and wasted my time for a price check, it was indeed a wrongly placed item and was actually $24.97 instead of $14.97. So devious of you, Walmart. I ALWAYS SEE AN ITEM RING UP WRONG EVERY SINGLE TIME I PURCHASE AN ITEM FROM YOUR STORES. Is this how you extort more money out of taxpaying American Citizens? Is it not enough that my tax dollars FEED your employees? That my tax dollars GIVE YOUR EMPLOYEES ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE? I doubt it does considering the extreme profit margin your corporation gains from SNAP!!! I am a five person household with foster children and we do not qualify for the safety net that you exploit. Citizens United declared you a person and if you had actually flesh, you should be ashamed of yourself. If Walmart had a body it should be in prison for what you do as a business. $10 dollars means nothing to you but it has value to me. I will WASTE GAS to avoid your business any further. My household is forevermore forbidden from associating with the evil, vile, corrupt ""person"" that is Walmart.

"Walmart, what has happened to your customer service?! I would like to think that poorly trained employees is centralized to one location near me, but there are 6 of your stores within 10 miles of my home and I have had terrible experiences at ALL of them! In one instance I was looking for an item, stopped a young man to to ask him where it was and he replied ""I don't know"" and just walked off. \nAt another of your locations I was grocery shopping and had a coupon for almost every item I purchased. When I walked up to the register I greeted and immediately handed her my coupons. Generally a cashier would look through them so that as they are scanning they can confirm that the items are being purchased. After she scanned my entire cart, I reminded her of my coupons and she looked at me in all seriousness and said ""I can't except all these coupons."" When I asked why she said ""well I don't know if you purchased all these items."" I said ""ma'am you just scanned it all, would you like me to pull the items out that match the coupons?"" She again said ""I can't accept these."" So I asked to speak with a manager. I then had to stand there for 15 minutes waiting on a manager because the 2 that were working were on break at the same time! When the manager came finally I had to pull out each item for each coupon. This cost me another 20 minutes. Neither the cashier or manager were apologetic in any way whatsoever.  They treated me like using coupons I was stealing from the store. When in fact I'm just trying to provide for my family responsibly. Needless to say I avoid shopping with yall like the plague.

"Dear Walmart, (and any other company and employee who serves the public), I say this in the most polite way, please implement a no tolerance policy on serving the public. This issue in Georgia where your company employees refused to do their job because of their personal issues is ridiculous. If they don't want to fully serve then they can find a job else. But as a nation wide retailer your company should serve every customer according to their needs. If I want to come in and get a cake that supports law enforcement then I should be able to get that product from you with no hassle. Unfortunately yes that goes for those who may not believe as I do as well. Until it is seen that these employees have been terminated for failure to do their job, I will not shop at walmart. Political beliefs can be expressed in private but in a public setting it's all or nothing in my book.

"To whom it may concern:\nI have never been a big fan of Walmart but after buying our home and trying to furnish a house for two adults and 4 children and a dog I have found myself going to Walmart to get things I cannot find at stores such as Kroger. On my trip to Walmart today I took both of my babies who were so well behaved it was shocking. While checking out I realized that I would need a second cart to get out of the store so I nicely asked the cashier ""is there a way I could get a second cart and some help out of the store?"" To which he replied ""I cannot go get a cart for you, or follow you out to the car, perhaps next time you decide to come shopping you will bring help."" I stood there in awe especially when the young woman behind me told me that he had a point. As badly as i wanted to i did not leave my cart, i spoke my peace and left carrying my son on my shoulders and carrying my dayghters car seat while pushing my over filled cart to the car. Needless to say I am sending this statement and a strongly worded letter to Walmart, in dwindling hope that their customer service will ever change. \nWhy am I posting this on Facebook because the world needs to wake up. I took my kids to the store because after working all week it was a chance for me to spend time with them, and get errands done, so we can cook dinner and relax tomorrow evening. I am tired worn out and at this moment holding a sick baby wearing a t-shirt covered in baby food and baby puke because my daughter cries every time I lay her down. I think it's time for a revolution in this country to bring back a little decency, hold doors for elders, pay it forward, help a mother with a cart load and two babies get out to the car safely. It really does make a difference, I know I want to end till these values into my own children.","2016-09-26T07:16:49+0000","159616034235_10154695721574236","walmart",

"Todd Starns reports in an article today that workers in the WALMART on Willow Dr. in McDonough Georgia refused to make a retirement cake with a photograph of the police officers flag-the black and white version of Old Glory with a blue line, for her fathers retirement from the police force. The workers said it was ""racist"".  As an alternative, the daughter suggested a chocolate frosted cake with a horizontal frosted blue line.  That design was also rejected by the cake decorator.  What has happened to this country???   WALMART had better get a grip on their employees, and the cake decorator that refused to make it, even after the manager offered to make the cake.  This employee needs to be terminated immediately!  I encourage anyone who reads this post to call the store manager and demand that the employee be fired. The store phone number is: (678)432-2023.  I for one refuse to do any more business with WALMART.  Will be taking my business from now on to Target.","2016-09-26T06:34:49+0000","159616034235_10154695600099236","walmart",

"I want everyone to know about the experience I had at my local walmart. I went in to exchange my cell phone that was malfunctioning bought the day before. I had my receipt and everything was in order except the bar code was not reading correctly. After calling the manager and both had handled the phone repeatedly, noticed the stylus missing. The stylus was not missing when i gave them the phone after a heated argument and finding out they deactivated my cell phone account, I requested they return my receipt. After a few more minutes they had to admit they had lost the receipt also. \nThis would have been ok except they deactivated my account and refused to fix the problem  and told me to call straight talk and fix the problem they created myself. Then to top off the hole experience, they refused to exchange the phone, refund anything, or find my receipt. So my story ends with walmart stealing my money because even after admitting the receipt was recieved and they where at fault for losing it. I I was the one who would pay the price. I had to fix my cell phone account 45 minutes, buy a new phone 200 dollars and after everything they kept the broken one 200 dollars.

Stumbled across some Star wars stuff I was looking for I put them in the cart. Later when we were checking out the register began giving me a ""Restricted"" warning so I flagged over an associate and went to investigate. Returned a few min later to tell me that she can check the prices and see they are in the system but could not sell them to me. She said there wasn't a manger in the dept. that could investigate and I could return the next day. We were staying about 30 mins away in a cabin and weren't going to venture that direction again. Missed out on my elusive pieces. My question is how are you going to assign a sku, print a label for the shelf, stock said shelf, then you can't sell them to a consumer? It's stupid and idiotic.

"Well I am not an employee but a very unsatisfied customer that will never again order anything from Walmart again. My story starts with ordering a appliance online at Walmart, paid with credit card, picked delivery date to be Oct. 3rd. Get confirmation e-mail for the order and the delivery date, all set! or so I think........ Well the home I am having it delivered to is not lived in yet, we were getting all the appliances and so on before moving in, so there is no water on or power on yet and we live in the south and boy its hot! ........so on with my story, on Sept 23rd, we go to the house to see how the contractor is doing and the work is coming a long and low and behold there in the front yard the appliance we had ordered from Walmart.com is dumped! Its upside down (great for a freezer) the corners are damaged, the packaging is 1/2 missing, and also there is rust, yes I said rust on the freezer where paint has come off, so not only did it look like they kicked it off the back of the truck but they sent it damaged to start with!!! So my husband calls Walmart.com to let them know they not only sent our item 1 1/2 weeks early but they sent damaged goods and just dumped it in the front yard upside down. Soooooo the lady says that they will send Fed X out on Saturday to pick it up between 10 am and 12 pm, we go to the house (keep in mind how hot it gets in the south and we have no power yet) and we sit there waiting, well 12 pm comes and goes and we wait a bit longer and still no one in sight.....My husband gets back on the phone again and the lady he speaks to this time tells him that Fed X doesn't set a time, that they can be there anytime between 8 am and 8 pm, so my husband kindly lets her know that is not acceptable as we have no power and its hot as a dickens here. She apologizes and says there is nothing more she can do. The husband now asks to speak to her manager as this is not acceptable, she gives him a reference number as he will need this to speak to someone higher up, then she puts him on hold, he was on hold for over 30 minutes getting more upset as the minutes tick by, finally a man comes on and asks how he can help, my husband tells him the story and he says how sorry he is and that's nice and all but it doesn't fix the problem, my husband tells the man that all he wants is his credit card to be refunded with a full refund and for the to come pick up the freezer. And to top it off, this man tells my husband that FedX doesn't work on Saturdays!! but yet two yes two different employees told us they would be there to pick it up on Saturday (they don't even train their employees or provide them with up to date information) and then he comes back and tells my husband that he can't do a refund on his credit card until they get the freeze back and they will be there on Monday between 8 am and 8 pm, my husband tells him that we both work and are unable to be there all day like that and we don't have anyone that could sit in a house that has no power or water in the heat all day waiting that we need a set time, well they can't do that and he suggests we put it outside and leave it there for them to pick up so my husband asks and if it goes missing are you going to be responsible and still refund me the money, he says no Sir you are responsible is it goes missing. So lets recap, Walmart delivers the Freezer 1 1/2 weeks early without contacting us and letting us know they are going too, they dump it in the front yard damaged and upside down and they take no responsibility for any of it. They also tell us to make sure when sending it back that its properly packaged for shipping when they themselves didn't package it properly!, then we get told they will be there Saturday between 10 am and 12 pm by one person then another tells us 8 am - 8 pm and then this guy says they don't even work on Saturdays, and for us to place it outside with no one there for pick up but if it goes missing its our responsibility and we will lose our money! Well here we are talking to the 4th person whom is a ""supervisor"" so she asks how she can help, again my husband tells her the story start to that point and she agrees that we will be responsible and lose our money but yet its their mistake, so my husband asks to speak with the next person in command she proceeds to tell him there is no one above her that he will have to write a letter to head office! We are so fed up with Walmart.com we will never ever again order from them, We'd rather buy from Lowes and pay more and get treated better then we did here and get items that aren't damaged and delivered when they were set to be! I will be sure to let anyone and everyone I know about how we were treated and beware when it comes to dealing with Walmart.com..........please pass this on to all your family and friends!!!","2016-09-26T00:09:26+0000","159616034235_10154694858994236","walmart",

"Walmart off maple street and center street in Omaha Nebraska. Absolutely terrible customer service! I bought a PS4 and fallout 4 from them and when I brought the game (fallout 4) home, I opened it to find a DVD Called Battle: Los Angeles. I took my receipt back to the store I bought it from (maple street) and they told me that I can't return it only exchange it, which mine happened to be the last one. I asked if I could go to another store (center street) and they said yes that will be fine. When I drove across town to center street the employees were very rude to me in customer service and told me I opened it and can't return it or exchange it at their store, only the one I bought it from. I then called in the parking lot to a manager just to straighten things out and was on hold for 20 minutes. I the. Driver across town back to the original Walmart I bought the game from and had even worse service. First, an employee made a comment about a shirt and hat I was wearing, which were not appropriate, saying such a nice hat and shirt I had on (both of which I bought on a military base camp lejeune NC while I was stationed there) then another employee who was not a manager made the comment that I might have put the dvd in there because Walmart doesn't take used games and re wrap them (game was still in plastic). Then an assts. manager came and already had an attitude before she even came up to me to figure out the situation, making comment that they can't do nothing and won't. So I asked her why and she explained again that they wouldn't put a DVD in the game box so i asked her if she's calling me a liar, and she said no but that's not what Walmart does, essentially calling me a liar. She was snippy and would not help me. I brought a receipt and during initial buying of the game was with my mother. Terrible service, awful leadership and all around bad experience. I now have a dvd I won't watch that was 40.00. I have never asked for a manager in my life, but twice I had to do that, once i sat on hold to long, the other was absolutely unprofessional. She was cold and heartless. I have documentation and pictures. I would not recommend either anymore.","2016-09-25T23:27:58+0000","159616034235_10154694766964236","walmart",
"It's pretty bad when the store only makes one of the two cakes ordered. They ended up making the one they forgot. I missed 30 minutes of my daughter's 2 hour birthday party waiting for her cake. Imagine the 8 yr old coming to get her cake to find out that they never even made it. It was after 2p when I finally got her cake, and we were supposed to be able to get it at noon. The workers made comments to make my daughter cry more by stating how she was done work at 2p. To which the 8 yr old started crying hysterically because she understood it as if her cake wasn't completed by 2pm, then the lady wasn't going to finish it. Bad situation all around. Bad by the bakery, and management did not seem to be too sympathetic. I buy 6 half shhet cakes per year for birthday parties.

"I'm just getting with of an incident where a police officer daughter wanted to get a special cake for her father retiring as a police officer after 25 years of service\nthat's a beautiful gesture on her behalf only to be ruined by the workers of your Walmart Center, I'm leaving the child out in Georgia that's what I'm talking about. As a retired police officer I find deplorable that this occurred. This is a slap in the face to all police officers whether they are active or retired. Yes I understand management attempted to correct this Injustice being out of their Realm of cake decorating it could not be corrected properly. A $50 gift certificate as a peace offering it's really nothing. It seems Walmart has a history of problems and supporting police officers and there is a lack of training of Walmart employees.\n\nWalmart needs to step up on a corporate level and do something for law enforcement to show they really care and I'm not talking about giving food or something of that nature but something large on a national level to show support. Furthermore Walmart needs to ensure all its employees are properly trained. There should be  stop discrimination against law enforcement.","2016-09-25T22:22:19+0000","159616034235_10154694627234236","walmart",

"Yesterday morning, Sept. 24th, I ordered 2 dozen Carbon ExpressTerminator Hunter arrows from walmart.com for pick-up today at the St. Peters, MO store and right after the confirmation email was another email cancelling one dozen of the arrows. I did the same for the St. Charles, MO store with the same results. I got an email for each order yesterday telling me the order was ready for pickup. I went by the St. Charles store today, Sept. 25th, and even though they said the order number was for a single arrow, they honored the order, started with only one arrow, but an assistant manager went back and grabbed 11 more for me without any issue. She said we had to refund the online order and ring them up in the store, but I got them at the ordered price. I went to the St. Peters store to pick up that dozen and was told that order had been returned and refunded. I hadn't seen anything in my email about the order being cancelled. They told me it would have come from walmart.com and not the store even though they said the store, or department, manager had cancelled the order. I called the customer service number the store personnel gave me and operator told me it was the store that cancelled my order. \n\nI can't say I'll trust ordering anything from Walmart.com in the future if the store can cancel an order after being told to come pick it up.","2016-09-25T22:17:04+0000","159616034235_10154694616114236","walmart",

The most recent is a case where two cake decorators refused to make a retirement cake for a police officer because it had a blue stripe and said blue lives matter. \n\nThis makes me wonder how many incidents are going unreported. Retaining these employees is costing your company money. Employees that disrespect any customer should be fired immediately.\n\nYes, Walmart is the largest retailer in the world, but if these types of action continue, it might find it hard to stay in business. The consumer is the reason you exist and like Target, a boycott by people that are tired of shoddy business examples would take a toll. You have already crossed the line by entering the political arena and now your employees are making a case for going elsewhere.","2016-09-25T19:55:51+0000","159616034235_10154694216314236","walmart",

"Maybe I'm jumping the gun but I tried to take advantage of this promotion. I received the Apple TV within 48 hours but the link for the trial offer of Sling TV and VUDU movies was never sent.

Believe it or not, I was fine with this solution. So, now my 2nd order for the Apple TV has shipped and guess what's NOT in my email? A link for the promo that I've attached below.

(And all that was with a nasty attitude) When he said that, I had had enough and asked the man Why he could not just switch places We were paying customers.  He still would not move, Bill asked the door greeter to get a manager and he refused to do so, said this was none of his business that is why he stepped aside. It was beginning to esculate and I just grabbed Bill and said it was not worth all that we could shop elsewhere and we left.  Now I donot now where we are going to shop, I do not shop Target anymore and I am not ever going back into Walmart.

"Is there a way I can speak with a supervisor, on the telephone.My order was cancelled by your company but you  still charged my personal master card for $146.38 It was suppose to  be updated with a full refund, but it still hasn't. I have used the only customer service number that this big company has for contact and keep getting the same story, even when I asked if I could speak with a supervisor, none is ever available. I tried the online chat, twice getting  the same runaround. Some of the answers I recieved were they have no record of my order number, but yet can tell me that my money will be put back on  my personal master card. One hundred and forty six dollars and thirty eight cents might not be a big deal for your company but for this grandmother it is. Please send me a telephone number where I can talk to someone who can finally fix this problem. Hopefully I can finally get this resolved, thank you in advance.","2016-09-25T15:41:54+0000","159616034235_10154693555094236","walmart",

Don't tell them to go online and find it on the web page.\n \nThey need to be told that any order can be tracked in their system.\n\nWhen a customer has called numerous times looking for their order, STOP blowing them off!!\n\nReally? Your own paperwork at Headqtrs shows it arrived at the store 7 days ago on the 18th, but Customer Service inside the store on Admiral / Memorial  told me each time I called, the order didn't arrive.\n\nNow I'm told the store can't even find the merchandise. What The Heck is going on with this company?!? \n\nHeadqtrs can't explain why they failed to notify the customer when it shipped.\n\nClearly there is a big ole problem in your business and the customers are suffering because of it.  \n\nYou are completely consistent on one thing, screwing up!!\n\nFinal note: If the product is back ordered, be honest enough to advise the customer and stop taking over 30 minutes to admit you screwed up!!!","2016-09-25T14:50:41+0000","159616034235_10154693403569236","walmart",

"Just wanted to share my unpleasant experience at Walmart in Covington tonight. I'm writing this post just as a reminder to always be paranoid and be familiar with your surroundings. Time frame was about 7:10-7:25pm. While Lydia and I were in the ladies restroom by the shoe department, there was a man that was knocking on the bathroom stalls saying manager, manager, manager as he was knocking on the bathroom stall doors. Thank God it was just Lydia and I and another lady in there with her child. So I immediately leave with Lydia in hand screaming out to the crowd don't go to the ladies restroom that there is a man posing as a manager wearing green shorts, with a green tank top with a man bun/ponytail knocking on the stalls saying manager. I was informing an employer who was on the paper towel aisle and he told me that there is nothing that he can do, but will review the tape. I then see the man leave the bathroom and I follow him and he was in the middle aisle getting a pack of ham. I then inform another employee and she stated that she would tell her manager but there's nothing they can do. So I then proceeded to talk at a higher voice level and I told the employee that he was a checkout at #8 and they just looked at me and said ok. \nSo just a reminder please don't ever let your children go to the bathroom by themselves no matter what age and never use the bathroom by the shoe department at the Walmart in Covington, because they have 2 back doors leading to the outside........","2016-09-25T04:46:56+0000","159616034235_10154692053774236","walmart",

"Worst experience ever with Walmart in Rochester Hills Michigan today I ordered four 12 packs of an item online and noticed that they were available from a local Walmart so I chose pickup in-store I received a notification that they were processing the order and then I received a text message that my order was ready to pick up I get to the store and they tell me that my order was cancelled because the items were not held in the store it was an online-only to have someone at the store cancel the order while I'm on the phone now they can't transfer shipping because the other shows cancelled at store level so I will have to reorder the items online only problem is you guessed it my money is tied up for up to a week because the store cancelled instead of letting me change my shipping as the manager suggested. I ask the cashier why she cancel the order and she said she was instructed to by the manager because they did not have the items in stock I've been asked why I received a text message saying that one of the four identical items was available for pickup they they indicated somebody from the store had pulled the wrong item in this early and I never should have got the notification because once again the product isn't carried in the store. So after driving 20 minutes each way to Walmart after receiving the text that said my order was ready I spend another hour at the store an additional 25 minutes on the phone only to leave Walmart frustrated they did nothing for me offered me nothing but excuses and they promised me that I would receive an email that said my order was cancelled and my money would be refunded. I told them I was not leaving the store without something indicating that so they printed off receipt and handed it to me and it showed one item cancelled and three items available for pickup location in store I asked them about this and they said yes the order just wasn't cancelled yet and then I reminded them that I just spoke to a representative who said it was cancelled at store level. They couldn't explain why the register was still saying that. So as I walked away disgusted stressed two hours of my time wasted and only a promise that I may receive an email saying that my money would be refunded within 7 days the manager says if you don't get your money back or you don't get the email come back and see me in a week and I said so you will remember all of this for 7 days because I don't have anything to show you to remind you, except for a printout from the register that said three items were available in store. As I walk through the store on my way out disgusted I happened to pass through the department where my product normally would be found I saw the product available in singles but not in in a 12 pack, I walked back and suggested that the manager give me the individuals to equal the number I purchased and they refused said it was not their store policy. I can understand Mix-Ups I can understand mistakes on dot com orders what I can't tolerate is getting a text saying that the items were ready and driving 20 minutes each each way and wasting an hour and 15 minutes at the store only to walk away frustrated. #Walmart You can do better!","2016-09-25T00:32:47+0000","159616034235_10154691596424236","walmart",

"6:00 pm we received an email from Walmart saying your information has been changed. Please call to resolve this if you didn't make the change. We called... 3 different times. We we're told because my wife never shopped online and has no order number they can't do anything. So now my wife can't log into her account and someone out there has all of her information. When speaking with escalations I was told there's no manager or anyone else to talk to. They couldn't verify her account with her name, address, card number, or savings catcher card that is tied directly to the account. They said to call back and try to get the saving card back. I said what about her personal information that was stolen and they said they couldn't do anything about it. How safe is our information with Walmart? Clearly not as safe as they make it out to be. BEWARE SHOPPING AT WALMART, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR SHOPPERS AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE POOR SECURITY MEASURES ONLINE.

"My husband and I recently ordered a crate for our dog off of the website. We waited almost a week (which is a decent shipping time for such a large item)\nWhen it arrived, however, The metal bars were already bent in places, and the plastic tray in the bottom was cracked. We called to inquire what we could do, since we had paid for a new crate and received a broke and bent item. \nWe were told that we needed to prove that it was broken by sending text messages to a phone number and wait for a call back. We sent the pictures and did not receive a call. My husband called them back and asked what they would do for us. They stated that they would send a new crate,  my husband asked when it would arrive, he was told as soon as it get there and he was then hung up on. I am shocked that not one person apologized, and I think we should have been over-nighted a new product.

"I ordered groceries on your online service where you pick your groceries up. I had trouble with some of the items that were sent to me. I called up to the store. I spoke with Jennifer.\n\nWhen I first talk with Jennifer. Jennifer said that I was unable to return my products to Walmart. She was incredibly nice and helpful. But the information she provided it just didn't sound right. So I call back and I spoke with\na gentlemenare you at\nThe gentleman said that I could return the items. I spoke with the gentleman he proceeded to go off on me and in the middle of the conversation I advised him that this is not OK and he continued with rude behavior. I asked for his name. He refused I asked him about three times for his name. He refused. He threatened to hang up on me. As soon as I was off the phone with the gentleman. I called and spoke with the general manager of the store. He turned what could have been a bad situation into a positive situation and I have nothing but glowing words to say about the general manager and his team.   After hearing my story the general manager offered to deliver the items that were missing from my receipt and provide me with a gift card to make up for the rude behavior up of the individual at his store. But because I was coming up to the store. I Stated that I would just pick it up at the store and he wouldn't have to come out to the house. And this is very kind of him as I am disabled and I am unable to get out the bed without someone picking me up and putting me in a wheelchair. This is why I ordered my groceries online with Walmart. And the first time that I ordered it I thought I was going to have a bad experience because I had to call up there three or four times. The Walmart is located in Queen Creek or Santan Valley. The manager of the location his name is Ralph. I do not know his last name. This wonderful man turned what could have been me taking my business to another store. That's because before he called me I was going to start having Safeway deliver the groceries to my home which was a better option for me anyway. Sometimes you feel like Walmart is a big corporation and you can't get any feedback on something goes wrong. But today your general manager Ralph made me feel like I was an important customer. If you decide to honor him I would love to get some notification. This was the best experience that ever had at a Walmart.  As a business consultant  little things like that to me are important.I have bachelors accounting and a Masters in international real estate and all I do is consult businesses on how to be successful. And I've learned that customer service is one of the most important things for repeat business. If a customer feels that they are not valued they will not return. The general manager at the Hunt highway location made me feel like I was a value customer and for that reason and for that reason only I will continue to shop at Walmart. Please recognize this superhero. He deserves a lot of recognition. Please follow up with me I would love to see what type of recognition he received. My name is Adriel Spiller","2016-09-24T21:46:33+0000","159616034235_10154691193694236","walmart",

This puts MANY MANY of your food products (including the roast chickens) off my list of foods I can eat.  Here's a suggestion, instead of spending Millions of dollars  in ads trying to get customers, how about lowering the sodium (you soak those roast chickens in salt water) so that you don't LOSE customers you already have.  And how about having more low-sodium products in general available, perhaps in a separate section (labeled Low Sodium) so we could find them.","2016-09-24T21:46:21+0000","159616034235_10154691193494236","walmart",

"This is ridiculous, someone needs to handle this, how in the world are you allowing this to go on??\n\n#BOYCOTTWALMART: So my buddy's sister went to Walmart in McDonough, GA to have a cake made for their father's retirement party. He's retiring from being a police officer. She asked Walmart to make a ""thin blue line"" cake to commemorate his extensive and honorable service as a dedicated police officer. Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being ""racist."" Three separate people in management denied her request for this reason. To me, this is appalling. There is nothing racist about the symbolism behind the ""thin blue line,"" yet people CHOOSE to make EVERYTHING about race. I'm so tired of it. It's literally exhausting for me to think about now. It's only ignorant people who continue to spread this negativity. People need to educate themselves. Bottom line. I'm just waiting for the day that our American flag is deemed ""racist"" by ignorant instigators who are just looking for attention and for something to be upset about.

"Well I am not an employee but a very unsatisfied customer that will never again order anything from walmart.com again.  My story starts with ordering a appliance online at walmart.com, paid with credit card, picked delivery date to be Oct. 3rd. Get confirmation e-mail for the order and the delivery date, all set! or so I think........ Well the home I am having it delivered to is not lived in yet, we were getting all the appliances and so on before moving in, so there is no water on or power on yet and we live in the south and boy its hot! ........so on with my story, on Sept 23rd, we go to the house to see how the contractor is doing and the work is coming a long and low and behold there in the front yard the appliance we had ordered from Walmart.com is dumped!  Its upside down (great for a freezer) the corners are damaged, the packaging is 1/2 missing, and also there is rust, yes I said rust on the freezer where paint has come off, so not only did it look like they kicked it off the back of the truck but they sent it damaged to start with!!!   So my husband calls Walmart.com to let them know they not only sent our item  1 1/2 weeks early but they sent damaged goods and just dumped it in the front yard upside down.   Soooooo the lady says that they will send FedX out on Saturday to pick it up between 10 am and 12 pm, we go to the house (keep in mind how hot it gets in the south and we have no power yet) and we sit there waiting, well 12 pm comes and goes and we wait a bit longer and still no one in sight.....My husband gets back on the phone again and the lady he speaks to this time tells him that FedX doesn't set a time, that they can be there anytime between 8 am and 8 pm, so my husband kindly lets her know that is not acceptable as we have no power and its hot as a dickens here.  She apologizes and says there is nothing more she can do.  The husband now asks to speak to her manager as this is not acceptable, she gives him a reference number as he will need this to speak to someone higher up, then she puts him on hold, he was on hold for over 30 minutes getting more upset as the minutes tick by, finally a man comes on and asks how he can help, my husband tells him the story and he says how sorry he is and that's nice and all but it doesn't fix the problem,  my husband tells the man that all he wants is his credit card to be refunded with a full refund and for the to come pick up the freezer.  And to top it off, this man tells my husband that FedX doesn't work on Saturdays!! but yet two yes two different employees told us they would be there to pick it up on Saturday (they don't even train their employees or provide them with up to date information) and then he comes back and tells my husband that he can't do a refund on his credit card until they get the freeze back and they will be there on Monday between 8 am and 8 pm, my husband tells him that we both work and are unable to be there all day like that and we don't have anyone that could sit in a house that has no power or water in the heat all day waiting that we need a set time, well they can't do that and he suggests we put it outside and leave it there for them to pick up so my husband asks and if it goes missing are you going to be responsible and still refund me the money, he says no Sir you are responsible is it goes missing.  So lets recap, Walmart delivers the Freezer 1 1/2 weeks early without contacting us and letting us know they are going too, they dump it in the front yard damaged and upside down and they take no responsibility for any of it.  They also tell us to make sure when sending it back that its properly packaged for shipping when they themselves didn't package it properly!, then we get told they will be there Saturday between 10 am and 12 pm by one person then another tells us 8 am - 8 pm and then this guy says they don't even work on Saturdays, and for us to place it outside with no one there for pick up but if it goes missing its our responsibility and we will lose our money!  Well here we are talking to the 4th person whom is a ""supervisor"" so she asks how she can help, again my husband tells her the story start to that point and she agrees that we will be responsible and lose our money but yet its their mistake, so my husband asks to speak with the next person in command she proceeds to tell him there is no one above her that he will have to go too the head office in person that they don't speak to people over the phone only in person!  We are so fed up with Walmart.com we will never ever again order from them, We'd rather buy from Lowes and pay more and get treated better then we did here and get items that aren't damaged and delivered when they were set to be!  I will be sure to let anyone and everyone I know about how we were treated and beware when it comes to dealing with Walmart.com","2016-09-24T19:53:39+0000","159616034235_10154690783859236","walmart",

"Ok I have a question why Wal-Mart don't offer store credit. First of all I have no problem with exchange, I would rather have an exchange. The air mattress bed that exchange yesterday that exchange with good, I took the bed home and last I opened and took it out of the box and pumped it up lord behold it has an hole in, couldn't even sleep on it. I put it back in the box it came in and took it back for an exchange, the store was out so I couldn't exchange it, customer service told me to check with a different Wal-Mart to exchange, the time was 10:00 customer service is closed, so I asked for a refund so I could buy another one. I couldn't get an exchange or get my money back so I had to come out of pocket and buy another bed, now keep this in mind now when you buy  something you take it home and you find out its damaged. So you take it back for exchange the store is out of the merchandise you trying to take back they don't give refund because it has been open now how was I supposed to use without opening it, go figure.  WHY NOT OFFER STORE CREDIT, that's not giving a refund that's giving you credit to go and by the product at another store. Wal-Mart is the #1 store the only store I shop at and last night and today was bad business and it could been handle differently.

"Last night I visited Walmart on Old Fort Parkway in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.  I needed help finding something in the grocery section, but there were no associates at ALL on the floor in that department, which is ridiculous.  I went to the deli to ask why nobody was around and they said, to my amazement, everyone goes on break at the same time!  So I asked the woman to page somebody, and she did.  10 minutes later, still nobody had appeared to help me!  At this point, I asked the woman in the deli to send the manager, and even he/she would not come out.  What kind of customer service policy is this?  You don't send everyone on break at once and leave nobody tending the store.  And shame on the manager of this store for not making it right.","2016-09-24T16:26:32+0000","159616034235_10154690299379236","walmart",

I grabbed these up quickly. There were even packages of the flag on the ground shoved between the floor and the shelving. I'm very disappointed in this lack of respect to our nation's flag.\n******\n) The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.\n\n)The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.\n\n) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.\n*******\nWalmart is essentially America's store; but if you're going to sell the flag, you need to learn how to care for and respect the flag. \nIMG_6314.PNG","2016-09-24T05:53:35+0000","159616034235_10154688836189236","walmart",

"Walmart, I purchased wedding gifts from your wedding registry last spring and  just a few days ago.  Both times, I had the gift sent directly to the bride/groom.  However, both times, my gift was sent without any material informing the recipient of who sent it, causing confusion for the bridal couple.  I wish you had a card for the purchaser to fill out during the order process that could be included with the merchandise so that we could explain who it is that is sending the gift.  It is not always the name on the credit card who represents everyone who is sending the gift.  And, there should be some kind of packing slip indicating a purchaser's name.

"Walmart will never touch another one of my vehicles, and I would caution anybody who decides to use their Auto Care services. You might save a couple dollars up front, but you will end up spending significantly more in in headaches and repairs down the road. Walmart does not stand behind their work. We had a horrendous experience the last time we used the Walmart Auto Care Center. During the course of routine scheduled maintenance on our 2010 Kia Soul one of Walmart's techs removed a hose from the transmission and failed to replace it when he was done. Within the next 12 hours we had lost 4 quarts of transmission fluid and ended up stranded in the middle of nowhere. We had the vehicle towed to the nearest Kia dealership and they diagnosed the problem: ""TRANS COOLER LINE TAKEN OFF AND WAS LETTING FLUID RUN OUT."" Even with written proof from the Kia dealership that the hose was removed, Walmart has denied our claim. Additionally, they have refused to answer multiple inquiries about the cause of our claim denial. I am extremely disappointed in their workmanship and ""customer service""","2016-09-23T21:36:49+0000","159616034235_10154687871054236","walmart",

"I've been shopping Walmart for MANY years now.  I shop at the store as well as the site.  I have to say I'm really disappointed with your customer service this time.  I ordered from Walmart.com to pick up in store.  Two out of three items were suppose to be available right away but I never received an e-mail stating it was ready for pick up.  I 'chatted' with Walmart online only to be told that the two items were 'processed incorrectly'.  I was told to go to the store for a refund because a refund couldn't be done online.  I went to the store and, after some confusion, the associate refunded those two items.  One of the items were a set of 2 pillows by Sertapedic.  When the third item became available I went to the store to pick it up.  The associate thought I was there to pick up all three items.  I explained that the first two were refunded because I was told it wasn't available (specifically the pillow set).  He pulled out the pillows he had , which were only single pillows, not sets of 2.  I tried to explain to another associate that was helping this young man that I had ordered sets of 2 she completely ignored me.  She didn't even turn around to acknowledge me and what I was saying.  Well, I just took the third item and left.   About a week later I saw this set of 2 Sertapedic pillows become available again.  I ordered it again, this time to go to a different store because I didn't like the way I was treated at the first store.  When I went to pick it up there was only ONE pillow.  The young man at the site to store looked puzzled and told me he would see if there was another box.  There wasn't.  He then asked me if I wanted a refund and I said yes.  He tried to do it but told me to go to customer service.  I stood in line at customer service and was given a refund.  I don't believe in making a scene.  I called Walmart.com's customer service to be told ""Well, what would you want me to do?  I can't give a refund...... ""  I asked to speak to a supervisor who , then apologized but that was it.  I have to say I'm very disappointed.","2016-09-23T20:49:42+0000","159616034235_10154687725254236","walmart",

"Hi!  I would like to make a suggestion regarding payment options on our seasonal layaways.  I know that since this year's layaways are already in effect, it's probably too late to make the change.  However, I am hoping that it is something the corporation would consider making an option for next year and in the years to come.  Can you please make an ONLINE payment option?  It would be such a conveniece for so many of us as customers.  Besides, if you look at some of your rival stores that carry layaway whether all year round or only seasonal...they offer the online payment option (i.e. KMart, ToysRUs).  I just think that it would be a nice benefit to have a link located on the WalMart webpage during the layaway season that woud allow us to make payments online not just in the store.  It would be extremely beneficial for those of us who make weekly payments on our layaway to not have to press a screen for assistance and wait on a representative to assist us with a payment.  I am hoping that this will be carefully considered by a company that claims to not only save us money but to make our shopping experience quicker, easier and efficient!  Thank you for your time and consideration...looking forward to that holiday layaway payment link next year! ;D","2016-09-23T16:44:29+0000","159616034235_10154687115789236","walmart",

"You should really consider training your customer service workers better. Instead of attempting to fix a problem when they are are called they would rather lie about what they can do in a certain situation. The point of using Shipping pass is because you want a package quickly. I called because I found out my package was being shipped by ground instead of express after I used Shipping pass and instead of fixing the problem (which was still an option because my package was not picked up until hours after I spoke to numerous people at walmart.com) I was lied to over and over and people were rude.

"Unfortunately I cannot post a picture, and I know sending a complaint to corporate probably won't help but I have done it anyway. I purchased Parent's Choice training pants for my son and rolled over to wake up next to my son who's pull up had leaked through to my sheet and mattress. I'm very disappointed, I shop at Walmart regularly and their store brand products I have never had a problem with. This is my second attempt since buying this brand a week ago to see how they hold up over night for leaks and it is a successful FAIL. Honestly if it wasn't for their cheaper prices and being a single mother with a limited income, I would not shop at Walmart but I guess you get what you pay for. On the flip side I laugh when I see the commercial about the CEO working for the employees to make sure they are taken care of. I had called the manager at the Clio Michigan Walmart to tell him one of his associates not only did her job but went above and beyond to assist me and the message was never passed on to her. When I saw her again I expressed my gratitude and was upset to learn that the manager had said nothing to her and when I was talking to her she was reprimanded. I had spent less than 3 minutes speaking with her as I entered the store to shop near the U-scan.","2016-09-23T08:59:45+0000","159616034235_10154686143674236","walmart",
"Note to Users trying to use Grocery pick up so to save you time (like the over an hour I just wasted) IF YOUR BILLING ADDRESS IS A POST OFFICE BOX IT WILL NOT PROCESS. It lists a tech issue that goes away if you use a home address but of course the card will not process without the matching billing address.  Since I live in an area with rampant mail theft I guess I don't get to save on groceries.   I think that is a bit discriminatory,  It was the same with setting up the account no PO Boxes but 99.9 percent of other apps let you add the second address for billing, I guess not Walmart. Funny enough since it takes PO Boxes on the non grocery side and ships my stuff just fine.  So much for the $10 off and the wasted time.

Why should I be stuck with someone's half eaten snacks?

I could buy it online 12.6 oz bottles 20/ carton for $5.14 but they were sold out online even though I was able to add to my cart. The good thing was it was in stock at my local store and even a better deal being advertised 20/carton for $.88So get the soap, load it all up. Go to the check and the cashier calls a CMS. The CMS then refuses to do the sale even though it is advertised online and in store on the app. Calls another manager who then says the app doesn't look at the product and frequently puts the wrong heading. How is that my fault? We left soap less. Trying to figure out how this isn't false advertisement?

When I call tonight I'm told they couldn't find my claim lucky for me i had the reference # , then they said they sent it to the wrong address, so now they expect me to wait another 3-5/days for it to arrive and them tell me it will take 24-72/hours from the time the label is scanned to receive my egift card. So that doesn't fly well with me, I requested a supervisor who tells me there is nothing he can do, but I can always go out and buy another product and pay myself back when they receive the product.Really I don't think so .lesson learned won't be purchasing anymore protection plans from Walmart.","2016-09-23T02:11:00+0000","159616034235_10154685457184236","walmart",

You do not tell your employees why you are  cutting their hours, you do not explain anything to them and wonder why people quit.

"Walmart has been accepting my Native American ID for money transfers for close to two years.  Less than an hour ago, they told me I could not use it.  The management did nothing to help me or explain why multiple store employee where able to make all my previous transactions.  They acted like I was a liar, just making up a story to get my way.  I have the receipt from the last transfer from earlier in the month.They gave me no answers at store 5221 in Tampa Florida.  Kevin (M.O.D.) was especially rude as I was explaining how I have been using my tribal ID for every previous transfer, before I could even finish he continued to shake his head left to right as in no.  Ginny (AP) was also no help.  She said she would investigate the problem but when I asked her how, she would not tell me how she would get this done. It seemed to me all they wanted was to get me out of their store than actually help me.I find it hard to believe that if this has been no issue for the transfers that I have been receiving for twice a month, every month since 2015 but today all of a sudden it is.  And they could not even explain why.  Shame on you Walmart for treating Native Americans the way you do.

"WALMART does not care about its customers. I have purchased 2 tvs through walmart.com and both were delivered broken. Sent the 1st one back via fedex and their warehouse had it for a week before I called and asked about my replacement. They said they were having computer issues. I asked how long it would have been if I hadn't called and brought it to their attention before I would have received my new tv,they didn't have an answer.  Got me replacement tv less than a week later, this time delivered by ups, and it was broke more than the one I sent back. I called 1800walmart and told them I wanted to return this 2nd broken tv to a store since I can't depend on walmart to deliver a pristine unbroken product. The customer service rep told me to take the tv back and ask the manager to give me an upgrade to similar size tv for the same price and to call back to 1800walmart if I had any problems. Get o the store and the manager won't deal with it because the tv was bought at walmart.com. I call 1800walmart and they supposedly have no record of what the person said to me because they don't actually record phone calls. And its not their usual practice to promise such things.  So basically the cs rep lied to me to get me off of the phone. So I ask to be connect to corporate and they promptly hang up on me. Now they did credit me with 10% off but when I returned the tv today they refunded my money mi nus the 10% so basically I still got nothing but a screw job from the whole of walmart.  They don't care that this tv was for my church and my Sunday School class. They don't care that the children and I have both been disappointed twice now. I'm fed up with the whole situation.

"I'm so disappointed.  I went to two stores today looking for an air mattress.  I found one at the second store that I thought would work well so I bought it.  Got it home, opened the box up and as I started to spread it out - I noticed that there was a giant rip in it, that it smelled like cigarette smoke (I don't smoke), and then finally that it wasn't even the same brand!  Someone clearly purchased the item, put their used one back in the box, and took it back to the store.  I am so disappointed.  Mostly in other people.  I don't blame the store much, because it was wrapped up back in plastic and the box was re-taped pretty well. I didn't even notice, and I look for those kinds of things.  Now I'm afraid the store will think I did it when I go to take it back.  I feel guilty for intending to take it back, but I paid $100 for it.  To top it off, I sprained my ankle trying to take it back out to the car so it's going to have to wait to go back, instead of immediately as I intended.  :(","2016-09-22T19:04:01+0000","159616034235_10154684493939236","walmart",

"I am so livid right now with Walmart I could scream.  \n\nWe spend so much money at Walmart, but every year we spend less and less because I personally have grown to detest them.\n\nMade a purchase online for some things using gift cards I received for my birthday.  Out of 3 orders and a handful of things between the 3 orders, FOUR things were out of stock.\n\nAnd I do not find out they are out of stock until the shipping and date to be delivered has passed!  \nThis is unacceptable....having worked for years in Planning/Inventory, I understand what is happening and it was verified today!\nWalmart has some very serious system issues.  Their systems do not update for TWENTY-FOUR hours.  So what that means is that for example, 1,500 people can order the same product and it can show all 1,500 that their orders were confirmed, shipped and set for delivery.  \n(Because according to BOTH Walmart and FedEx, they create a shipping label with a tracking number when it is ordered....NOT when it is SHIPPED!)\nThen when their system updates twenty-four hours later, and the fulfillment centers ACTUALLY only have 1,000 items in stock, they ship to 1,000 of those customers with the other 500 'thinking' their item is coming and they don't have a clue it isn't until the delivery date is past.\nOn top of this, an authorization hold is placed on funds from your credit card or bank until the order is canceled...which may take over a week for those 500 customers to find out to start with.  And then it takes another 5-7 days AFTER they cancel the order for your funds to be available again to use.\nThis is outrageous.....to have funds tied up because Walmart has a prehistoric system that cannot update their inventory in real time.\n\nAm so against frivolous lawsuits, by Walmart should be sued and reamed for this practice...all because they are too cheap to upgrade their systems accordingly.\n\nAnd think about all of the Walmart man hours wasted in tracking this mess down...who got what, who didn't, canceling orders and releasing funds back, and listening to irate customers.\n\nHave spent four hours in the last two weeks online or on the phone with FedEx and Walmart trying to figure out where and why I had not received 4 out of 8-9 items from 3 orders in TWO weeks.\n\nWent online and immediately ordered it from Amazon and it will be here Monday....and you can believe it will too.\n\nAmazon has gotten so much of our business in past years, and every year they get more and more.  Today they got the rest.\nWalmart stockholders...take note as to why stock in going down....because Amazon ROCKS and Walmart SUCKS!","2016-09-22T18:33:28+0000","159616034235_10154684403429236","walmart",

"Hey Walmart, I researched online what product I wanted and then went to your store to purchase it.  Sylvania 7"" Premium Dual Screen Portable DVD Player, SDVD8739.  Reviewing my receipt when I got back to work I found I was charged $68.96 for this item and not the price I shopped of $59.98. I called the store and spoke with a rather rude Assistant Manager ""Nicole"" who told me ""it just dont work that way""  There was nothing on the webpage stating that the pricing in store is different.  There was an option for free in store pickup in which case Nicole tells me that I could have received the lower price but just coming into the store doesnt guarantee you pay what you advertise.  Is it really your policy to mislead price conscious consumers who use your website to compare with other retailers before they make a physical purchase?  Because that's how this consumer is feeling right now.","2016-09-22T18:21:11+0000","159616034235_10154684370839236","walmart",

I explained to her what happened and she stated a manager should have been contacted, but again did not get one or help me in any way.

I was very disappointed with the Walmart on-line grocery shopping promotion made here in Cartersville with flyers being mailed to all residents, but no service available.  I asked friends on FB if they had used the service and all comments from several were positive.  My health is not so great right now, so I was excited as I signed up, made out a big order, and when I tried to schedule a pick-up, found the nearest store offering this service is over 22 miles away straight into some of the worst traffic the Atlanta metro area has to offer - would take a good 45 minutes to an hour each way and pass another 2 or 3 Walmarts to get there.  I asked at the store if/when the service would be available here and was told it will not be due to corporate not authorizing extra employees to make it work.  My next question was why, then, did Walmart waste the money to send out nice flyers to everyone in Cartersville for a service they have no intention of offering here.  No answer for that.  I would love to see the service implemented here.  It would certainly help me out and I am sure many others,","2016-09-22T17:57:29+0000","159616034235_10154684302634236","walmart",

"To whom it may concern:\nThis is to let you know that yesterday at 3pm (est) I went to pick up a prescription from the Walmart store at 4400 W. Tennessee Street, Tallahassee, Florida  32310 (which was called in from her drs office early that morning) for my granddaughter, I was told it wasn't ready but needed to give her insurance information to the drop off clerk. I gave the clerk the information and I asked when it would be ready, I was told 7pm. I asked if it could be ready any sooner than that while explaining the fact that I lived 30 minutes away and that waiting 4 hours was not feasible and that had the meds been for an adult it wouldn't matter that I come back the next day on my way to work but because it was for a baby under the age of 2, that it was important that she takes this medicine. I was promptly told NO..there was 54 ahead of me and that I would have to wait. When the Pharmacist/manager came over to see if there was a problem, the clerk immediately spoke up stating that everything was okay before I could say ANYTHING. Instead of getting angry, I walked away. I immediately sought out the store manager and after explaining to him my situation and what transpired, he instructed me to stay where I was at and he would talk to the Pharmacist to see if there was anything that could me done to fill it sooner. The manager came back to me instructing me to go with him to the pharmacy area to talk to the Pharmacist/manager who was the same person who came to the clerk asking if there was anything thing wrong. \nHe asked me why I hadn't said anything to him when he came to the window and I explained to him what the clerk had told me and her rude behavior towards me.\nThough I don't condone racial prejudice, nor do I practice racial prejudice, I was treated with total disdain and dismissed by an African American female who is employed by your company/store.","2016-09-22T16:34:37+0000","159616034235_10154684076729236","walmart",

"I am very disappointed in the service I received today from an online order I placed on Saturday. I paid extra to receive my items early. Only to receive an email today that the last of my order will not be here till sometime next week. The only thing I was offered was my shipping taken off. You need to update your website to reflect that your shipping dates are subject to change regardless of the amount that you pay in shipping to receive an item. Now I have to figure out how I am going to get what I need for this weekend. I am beyond frustrated at this entire process. Spent an hour and half on the phone trying to figure out a solution and the solution I was given even at the corporate office was just my shipping waved. This is not acceptable. I don't know why we couldn't find a comparable item in the store that I could just go and pick up. Since they said they could cancel it and refund my money but not cancel it and find me an alternate item to walk into a store and pick up. I find it hard to believe that this is outside of their control.","2016-09-22T15:29:52+0000","159616034235_10154683882834236","walmart",

Three of the items in my cart were videos as I was checking out I noticed the videos were missed labeled. To make a long story short I spoke to the assistant manager ( a very rude young lady) who told me she didn't care if they were missed marked or not she was not going to honor the miss labling. I tried to tell her Walmart always honors the mislabel pricing. She said "" I don't care I'm not going to change the price"" and mind you as all this is going on there changing the labels.I WILL NEVER SHOP WALMART again.

"Question:  I would like to thank you the policy of price match,  I don't have much use of it but there are time's I do.  What it did do was change my shopping habit' where I do shop more at Wall Mart.\nWhat I have ran into is sometime I get asked do you have the sale flyer, and I have been told my the Manger no you don't need it.  But its a large price difference for a large amount than yes we would like to see it.  In my case most of the time its coke my wife drinks and I am close to Wall Mart and a few other items pick up so no problem.\n\nSo I guess my question is whats the Corporate policy on price match.\n\nIf its have sale bill I have no problem but would like some standardization.  It seems to change from manger to manger, store to store.\nMy soul is worth and a heck lot more than a few penny's. \n\nOne last suggestion: I use self check out most of the time I would like amount button for amount of items that are the same like scanning the same can of cat food 22 times.

"I am absolutely disgusted with your customer service. I made a return to the Walmart here in Greeley, CO. I paid using my Bluebird Amex prepaid card. Because I used it they said they could only return to my card. But did not explain that it could take 5 to 7 business days. Due to an emergency I had to wait on this refund to get essentials for my family.  Now had I been told it could take that long I would have asked for a gift card instead, so I could buy what I needed at the time. I looked all over your website, store policy, all over the Internet looking for a range as to when I would expect my refund. No where, I mean no where does it state how long it could take. So I decided to call your customer relations, which is a joke of a title. I spoke to Charles and he sounded so inexperienced that I was amazed that he was on the phone. Yes, I'm frustrated. Yes, I'm tired from my ER visit. And this rep was clearly trying to get me off the phone with no information. I received no help at all as to what to do. And when I asked for a supervisor he refused till the 4th time I asked. He kept trying to say it was a Savings Catcher issue. When I tried to explain it was actual funds of my own he still tried to tell me the same thing. Then told me to call a different number but gave me no explanation as to why I should call or even what they do. He just kept saying he didn't know and to try someone else or that I just have to wait. He kept telling me I had to call Bluebird. Bluebird can't do anything because they have no information on the refund. Then he says I had to call the number he gave me. When I asked if he could transfer me, that's when he proceeded to tell me their closed for the day! Then I finally got Will, a supervisor for customer relations, he did tell me that I had to call card processing services. The same people that Charles said to call but they are closed. Even though Will didn't have much more to say, he did have the experience and maintained his cool as a customer service rep should do. Either way I'm stuck because you guys don't know how to train your employees properly. No one can explain how long it will take or why. No one told me not to plan on having my money back. Any other company and I get my refund with in a day or 2. But not Walmart. This has been the worst experience I have had with you guys. I'm done with walmart. I will be taking my business to a store that actually explains what's going on and not try to give me the run around. Somewhere that values my money as a paying customer. Hopefully you guys don't have an emergency and end up in the same situation.","2016-09-22T00:24:01+0000","159616034235_10154681938049236","walmart",

Flash forward a week and my money was still not refunded, so I AGAIN contacted them only to be told that the order was NEVER actually canceled. Great. I would be getting my refund in 5 business days. Here we are, another week later, another call to Walmart and they want me to wait another 5 business days. SERIOUSLY!!!!!. If it was 20$ I'd say forget it. It's 165$ that they are basically refusing to give me back for an item I've never even laid eyes on! I had a similar issue with Toys r Us and they had my money back in my account in 2 days and- gave me the same item with 50$ off as a courtesy. I now have to wait 3-5 business days AGAIN for my money. Please share this-","2016-09-21T23:51:47+0000","159616034235_10154681894589236","walmart",

"I used to like shopping at Walmart; easy returns, good customer service, clean stores.  Now the stores are filthy, customer service is non-existant and returns are the same as all the other stores.  I tried returning bottles and cans before getting groceries.  A family of four was standing there waiting when we arrived for someone to empty the machines so they could continue with there shopping as well.  I intended to go to customer service once i finished returning what i could as no one came to manage the machines and I was told that they no longer take them there.  I needed to wait.  EXCUSE ME!  I need to get groceries after working all day and them make dinner and pack lunches for the kids with the groceries I still have to buy.  A perfectly polite man advised me that the guys who bring in the carts are the ones that deal with the bottle return machine and he kindly pointed to the other side of the parking lot and said he thought they were over there.  WHAT, am I expected to go inform them that the other part of their job needs handling?  No thank you.  I returned to my car,  loaded up my remaining bottled and cans and drove down the street to Price Chopper.","2016-09-21T23:15:37+0000","159616034235_10154681835479236","walmart",

"I am so disappointed in the customer service I have received recently with an online order. I was given the option to ship to the store because it would be received earlier than if I had opted to have it mailed to my home. My email said it should be available by 9/16. I have tracked my package online and it is showing that it has been at the store since 9/15, however it is not available for pickup. This is horrible customer service. I went online to express my concerns and was told that a store manager would call me, and yet, no phone call. So I am stuck without my order and without any assistance. This is unacceptable.

"Service Animal Policy - There has been an increase in pet dogs allowed inside my local WalMart (Windsor, Sonoma County). Why do I think they are pets? The number of eligible service dogs is small compared to the number I see entering the store for our community. There is no visible reason to assume they are service animals and the greeters are not asking the two allowed questions (Is that a service animal and what task does it perform?). An incorrect answer to those questions should deny access, but alas it probably is not. Additional procedures and training for Greeters and Managers is needed.  And I would like to see signage posted for the public that let's them know California will fine them for misrepresenting their pet as a service animal.  Fear of lawsuits should not drive an ""all or nothing"" approach from WalMart management.","2016-09-21T21:38:30+0000","159616034235_10154681647884236","walmart",

"Ever get confused about the difference between on line prices and in stock prices.  It's even worse for the three stores in Alamance county and customer service. I call it bait and switch.  I tried to order a simple"" pioneer women tea box for $28 the WM web site said it was in stock at that store, went down ,, not there.  So that night I purchased it on line so I could pick up at a different store the next day,, strike 2 not in stock, if it's at one warehouse it will take two days if it's at another warehouse it will take two weeks. I talked to a supervisor, this is what I gathered, instock at a store doesn't mean it's at the store but it's supposed to be, maybe. Online availability is  really not there cause it might be at two different locations depending what it is.. so DON'T believe what you read cause even the stores don't know cause the system only update at midnight, but that's not true either cause this morning my tea box should be at three stores in Alamance county but I know it's not.. confused yet.

So I drove 15 minutes to pick it up this morning, and there was no record of it.

And why would I want to do this again if nobody could figure out why it happened in the first place?  I know that Walmart is not Neiman Marcus, but customer service is supposed to do something to leave the customer feeling good about the interaction.

I ordered an item on September for ship to store and it still hasn't arrived and as if that wasn't bad enough nobody can tell me where it is or when it might deliver. So I spent $250 for an item I don't have and have no idea when I will get it and when I ask if I can simply cancel the order she explains that she can ""attempt to cancel"" but if it doesn't work I will have to still pick up the item (an outdoor couch) and ship it back for refund myself. So basically they are holding me hostage with the order. I don't have the item but I can't get my money back.

"Worst experience. I walked into a local Walmart store in huber heights Ohio and was greeted by a wonderful Halloween display that I of course had to go shop in. Unfortunately I left empty handed as the item on display that I loved was out of stock. When I spoke to the manager on duty I was told to look online and that they would not be receiving anymore Halloween product. If they've really not going to be receiving anymore then why have the display up still. I was told I could not by the display in case they got more. 🤔 I was then told to check online. No offer to check other stores. No offer to check online for me. Not even a sorry. So I still really wanted this item. So I checked online. Out of stock. I started a chat with customer service to try to find out if the item would even be back in at all. They did not know. However she did find a store within an hour that had the item. I saw online where it store had multiples in stock. So I placed the order online to pick up the following day. The next day I received and email stating the order was canceled! They apparently were out of stock! This makes no sense. Do they not pull the orders when you place an order?! Apparently not. So I contact customer service again. No help and short service. I was told the item is not in stock and to see go up to get a notice IF the item comes back in. So no one is understanding my frustration that the order was canceled when they had the product when the order was placed. I realize that it is out of stock now. Today. But it was not when I placed my order. I was willing to drive near an hour to give Walmart my business and they couldn't be bothered to pull my order.The chat representative made no attempt to search if other stores that may have it. This is unacceptable and rude service. Still I have not received a genuine offer of help finding the product. I am done with Walmart. Please tell your friends and family. I know I intend to.","2016-09-20T21:38:10+0000","159616034235_10154678789189236","walmart",

"Walmart in Opelousas is fraudulent.  I bought Allegra D; they said it had the same outcome as Mucinex D. Upon arriving home, I researched and found that Allegra D does not have the same effectiveness for what I have as the Mucinex.  I sent back and got the Mucinex, but they would not take back the Allegra, saying they told me that once I purchased it, it could not be returned.  BALD FACED LIE!!! If they had told me that, I would have done the research there, before I purchased, but, I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE SAME! Bottom line, they did not tell me that it could not be returned and no where on the receipt did it say that it could not be returned, and NO WHERE on the website is that policy stated. That is a BIG TIME Fraudulent, Non WRITTEN. Non VERBALIZED POLICY, that the customers have to find out after the fact.  I could see if it had been days of the purchase, but it was within 30 MINUTES!!! You All need to rectify that.

Thanks Walmart this is the last time I will ever shop at Walmart, I will be spreading the news via internet. Not once has Walmart made anything ever right with its customers. I'll spend more money at Fred Meyers, Winco, and Albertsons. Plus I know that Walmart leaves there uncooked whole chickens sitting in the back with flys all over them before they even cook them.

"Dear Walmart Human Resources, in your employee training are you mentioning the fact that if they are wearing their Walmart vest, even if they have punched out and they are ""off the clock"", they still represent their employer? I have had more than one encounter of attitude in the parking lot, usually as said employee exits the store wearing that big starburst vest, clearly representing WALMART. Yesterday as I was leaving a local store, tired, I was accosted by a woman who claimed to know me (never saw her before) claiming to be collecting money for a child with sickle cell/leukemia. I had none, she was quite rude and I reported her to the store as a beggar. As I drove towards the exit, having passed the crosswalk, two Walmart employees were apparently taking extra time crossing. Deliberately. Looking at me grinning. In their WALMART vests. Already tired and irritated from the previous encounter I gave a brief toot of the horn. Of course I got a dirty look.

"Went to the Walmart in Quincy, IL to have my headlight bulbs replaced.  I live in NH and traveled for a family event.  I got my car back very quickly too quickly I thought at the time.  I got in my car a couple of hours later by now it was dark.  I noticed that my lights were very dim I couldn't see.  I went back to my Aunts and opened the hood of my car to see if I could adjust the angle a bit.  To my surprise the bulb was just dangling there and the not held in place.  It was also missing one of the two plastic pieces that plug into the bulb and the V spring that holds the assembled pieces in place.  The other light was the same way.  I went back to the store but the automotive department was closed.  I explained the situation and took her out to my car to show her the issue.  I said to her that having replaced the bulbs myself always before that I knew exactly what was wrong and exactly what pieces were missing.  I asked if I could please look in the trash for the missing pieces as I would fix it myself but that fell on deaf ears.  I was told that she didn't have time to resolve my issue tonight as she had to watch a video.  She would have the manager of the Automotive department call me in the morning.  I said my biggest concern is that I need the pieces back to my car.  Now they have to review security camera tapes and such.  I guess I must just be making this up.  Not to mention the fact that when I went to place the lightbulb back how it was the tip exploded.  Now I am trapped 1300 miles away from home with a car that is now a safety hazard.  Thanks Walmart for the great service.","2016-09-20T02:32:32+0000","159616034235_10154676417154236","walmart",
"So, I went to the Carthage, TN store to buy a birthday gift for my mother from jewelry. I spent 30 minutes back there trying to get someone to come to wait on me. I even called the store and asked them to send someone to jewelry to wait on me. I finally left the store but called the manager on my cell after I left. He promised me that he would look into the event and call me back. That was five hours ago.

"Open Letter to Walmart on Citrus Blvd in Leesburg Florida\n\nWalmart.\n\nWith tonight 9/19/16 being the latest incident of problems in your parking lot (Man shot and killed) It is about time you start caring more about the safety of your customers and your employees and start having a armed security officer in your parking lot the whole time you are open.\n\nYour store management is well aware of the issues in the parking lot and if they are trying to hide it they are part of the problem.\n\nbesides tonight shooting and death ,You have numerous drug deals,homeless people approaching cards and all kinds of Illegal activities happen there daily\n\nWhat if the shooter tonight missed his target and hit baby or child, parent, grandparent etc. ?\n\nThe Leesburg Florida store is in a retirement area and I would estimate that atleast 1/2 of your customers are senior citizens who are receiving ZERO protection from you in your parking lot. The same goes for single women and mothers with children,\n\nIts time to step up to the plate and start providing 24 hour real security (Armed and trained) for the protection of your customers as you have opened yourself wide open to civil liabilities as its a well know fact around town that your parking lot is not a relatively safe one","2016-09-20T00:54:59+0000","159616034235_10154676204209236","walmart",

Got to the counter, no one there.  Waited and looked around for assistance (the bell had been removed) for about 10 minutes.  Could find no one.  Hubby went to the front of the store and found a Supervisor and requested some one to help us.  She said she would get some one right away.  10 more minutes passed.  No one came.  We went back to the Supervisor to report no one ever showed up and we were leaving.

I've never been overwhelmed by Walmarts customer service which is fine. It's always  good enough until now.

"I would like to say that buying food items at Walmart has never been an issue. Yes the lines and wait can be long sometimes but overall my experiences have been great. Well yesterday I went to Walmart to purchase some groceries one item was a bag of grapes. I had decided to eat a handful that night not thinking anything of it but my lips were tingling probably an hour after I ate them. I woke up at about 1am to a swollen top lip. I always wash my fruit thoroughly because of cleanliness and the use of pesticides. I called the corporate office in which I was instructed to go back to Walmart to return the grapes. I also stated to them I missed a day from work due to a swollen lip and I was instructed to talk to the store manager. I did as I was instructed and went to the customer service counter to explain my issues to the assistant manager who was very nice and did offer a refund of my purchase. I then ask to speak with the store manager to discuss the issue and she was so nonchalant about the entire situation. She walk up to me and stated"" Hi I'm the manager"" I explained to her what happened and that I missed a day of work because of my swollen lip. She then stated "" Well Walmart cant pay you for missing a day of work"" I then replied"" It was probably the pesticides on the fruit"". She stated"" we don't use pesticides and I replied yes all fruits are sprayed with pesticide. She then stated"" Well that had nothing to do with Walmart and I replied "" Yes Walmart is selling the grapes. She then stated "" You have to prove it"" She asked"" Do you have a medical history? Are you healthy? She was giving me the third degree. She was so unprofessional and no apology was ever made to me. I felt like I was in a confrontation with her the entire time so I ask for her first and last name then walked away frustrated.","2016-09-19T20:38:04+0000","159616034235_10154675558589236","walmart",

"FED UP CUSTOMER!!!  Placed an order through Walmart.com and one of the items was through overstock retailer on 9/1/16. It is still showing processing on Walmart.com. I contacted customer service and they gave me the number to call Overstock. I called them on 9/8 and they said there was a connection error between Walmart and them and they didnt get some orders and mine was one of them, they said they would push it through and that it would take a couple days. My order was still showing processing on 9/12 so I called again. I was told the same thing just that it is taking longer than they anticipated. Look again today, still processing so I called again. They said the same thing, its been nearly 3 weeks since I ordered it. I get told the same thing everytime I call. They said some orders are getting cancelled and some are getting pushed through. This was a comforter set that my son picked out for his 8th birthday for his new bed and his birthday has already past. I am tired of waiting. I was told that I cant cancel the order with Walmart but when I talked to Overstock they couldnt cancel the order either. So my order is being held hostage and so is my credit card.

"Your new store on Whitten & I-240 in Memphis, is a nice store, but I have never seen so many employees walking around doing nothing but talking to each other, also it had 2 check out lanes open for that huge store, it is absolutely ridiculous, Each time I go they are out of something, usually at least 2 items on my list.

"I got some ""cage free eggs"" from Walmart. The eggshells were so thin and fragile that my finger broke through the egg just from lightly picking up the egg. the tagline on the package says ""Hens free to roam, nest, and perch in a protected barn."" For honesty you  should add, ""malnourished trapped, underfed hens"". When I tried to call Walamrt I was put on hold for 10 minutes and still holding… Sorry Walmart, but my time is valuable. So this goes out on the intrnet instead. Stop greenwashing, while you continue to practice animal cruelty, and actually clean up your act.

"I belive Wal-Mart on Platte in Colorado Springs, Co. is actively supporting and participating in fraud. They are doing this by allowing their property to be used by Solon Pre-owned cars sales and giving them access to their parking lot. Solon has mailed out 1000's of ""Money Carlo"" flyers claiming to award $20,000.00, $10,000.00, $5000.00 in prizes. A search online finds that the ""Money Carlo"" scam is being used all over the country to trick unsuspecting people into visiting these sales events. All the cards have a wining ""777"" combination displayed in the 2nd position. These are not wining cards, the text is misleading. You have to match the confirmation number on the card to win. If you received one of these pieces please post your reaction on this site and contact the Store Manager to let him know it is violation of trust to support this kind of financial violence against his customers. It is nothing less than a ""Bait & Switch"" scam that was outlawed years ago. I personally am seriously disappointed in Platte Wal-Mart management for this kind of betrayal. It undermines everything that Wal-Mart Corporate is doing with their community support operations.","2016-09-19T17:14:08+0000","159616034235_10154675095439236","walmart",

"To the Walmart store in Calhoun,Georgia(30701). If you want the customers to shop there then do the flipping restocking at night instead of clogging up the aisles during the day in the food section. What, is it too hard to actually make those high dollar employees actually work or better still is it that hard to make the managers do their job? You have enough crap set up in the middle of the aisle's which no one seems to want but still can't the shelves be restocked as other Walmart's in the area have done. Why is this store so dirty and so unorganized? OH, I know, it's strictly due to the managers not doing their job. I have read that Walmart is moving some of the people out of the office section and putting them on the floor, well let's just see if they see what a mess that this store has become! If Walmart wants the customers to go to another store then all you have to do is say so, then let's see who will purchase your items that is never on the shelves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","2016-09-19T15:38:26+0000","159616034235_10154674905904236","walmart",

"I was trying to contact your company privately, however you have made it impossible to do so by limiting what we can contact you for. I am a sewer, quilter, craft person. I love the fabric department in my local store, but in most cases it is like pulling teeth to get anyone to cut fabric. No one hardly ever is in that department even though they are qualified to cut fabric. When someone with the store finally walks by and asks if you need help, they call on the little phone and it usually takes anywhere from 5-20 minutes for someone to show up, during this time several other associates come by, some asking if I need help and some just on their way to the back of the store. Then when they do show up, guess what? The scanner for the bar code on the fabric and the little computer that prints the label out for the register is missing. Someone from another part of the store during another shift has taken it and didn't return it. I have even had associates to suggest that I come back another day, as they don't have the equipment to help me. I also have had a person get angry at me and inform me that that wasn't their department and suggest that this was interfering with their job.                                                  I think someone needs to be in that department during regular business hours and that any equipment in that department should be left exclusively for that department. Like I said from the start, I love the fabric and craft department. It has been wonderful to go there while shopping in the store anyway, and for the most part, the associates are very apologetic for the long wait and they are helpful or are trying to get me help. Why are there not enough scanners and such for each employee? And why is there no associate to just handle the fabric department?

"To Walmart Corporate,\n\nI'm writing you based on an experience I had at one of your stores tonight. I have often shopped in Wal-Mart stores for at least 20 years. I'm intrigued by people, organizational behavior, consumer behavior, etc. Obviously, Wal-Mart has a model that works and made it the largest retailer in the world. However, I've never managed to be impressed with the customer service I've received at any location I've ever been other than one time about 2 years ago in my home city. Tonight, that all changed. I know that many hours and dollars are spent in training and developing the staff and the difficulties in retail. I say all that to say that, tonight my expectations were completely blown away by Mr. Hamid @ Store # 3388 Sugarloaf. He went above and beyond to find what we were looking for and despite our overlooking it. He found the items and called us back to sporting goods over the store intercom. Because of his help and enthusiasm, we bought extra items for gifts that we didn't intend. I would hope even if I don't get a response that at the very least this gentleman receives a congratulations from store management for a job well done! All retailers not just Wal-Mart could use quite a few more Mr. Hamid's on their team. \n\nSincerely,\n\nChris B.","2016-09-19T06:33:19+0000","159616034235_10154673871474236","walmart",

"Id like to give some feeback about my walmart.com order. So i purchased a 7 piece dinette set. When my order arrived the table was broke on the corner and the side of the wood was split that is where this nightmare began. We called the company right away only to have a hassel and have to do everything through email and we've yet to hear back from them we r on day 2. So the issues besides the table being broken we never received our chairs the table was a completely different table yes it may have been tge same color the table i ordered was suppose to be 64 inches long the one that arrived broken was only 48 inches ok maybe an honest mistake but if u further read the info on the table it states it comes with the table and 4 chairs but is clearly being advertised as a 7 piece set now im no mathematician but 4+1=5 not 7. So last night i was doing some further investigation the chairs r sold separate from the table and nowhere on the ad does it say sold separately. Now thats false advertising at its finest. Come on walmart ur a billion dollar company yet u falsely advertise merchandise then make it next ti impossible to get ur money back. Never again will i order from walmart.com . So upset that yall do business this way 300 dollars for a broken piece of crap table and no chairs. Ill post a pic in the comments of what i ordered.

"Yesterday my 81 year old dad bought a smart TV from your Dell City, OK supercenter.  When we put it up, the LED screen had some serious issues.   We took it back, a considerable chore because he lives about a 20 minute drive from the store.  The staff was very helpful, from the time we asked for help to get the giant screened monster from the car to the store, to actually helping us check the screen on the replacement TV.  Shaun, who works the returns desk, and Carl, one of the men who helped us wrestle the TV back into the car, and a tall, blond haired gentleman, whose name I didn't catch, we're both awesome and very pleasant.  Now,you'd think this was the end of the story, but you'd be wrong.  When we got the TV home, we noticed that the new TV was missing the remote.  Smart TVs don't work well without those. So since it was late, we called the store and told them about the missing remote.  They said they would get the one from the original TV and save it for him to pick up the next morning.   He did just that, only to discover that it was a remote to a different brand of TV.  Well, to save him from having a stroke from irritation, I went in to get the right remote.  A woman named Brittany was very helpful. Now, I would love to see the people named get some kind of atta boyfriend their efforts.

"Sparta, Illinois WalMart....\nBe very careful that you have all your packages before you leave the store. This past week I discovered that I was missing approximately $25 in merchandise after I finished unpacking my groceries at home. I returned to the store with my receipt only to be told that there was nothing in ""the book"" listing those items as left behind at a checkout.(Which means the next customer got my left behind bag and it was not reported). I was then told ""she"" would look at the video of that checkout lane and try to see what had happened to those missing items, but it would take a while to look. I did a bit of shopping then returned to the customer service desk to be informed that the video showed the customer put the bag containing the items in their cart. Since I'm the customer in question and I obviously do not have the items, I find that very hard to believe. I was not shown the video, I just had to accept what they said, and I have no idea if they even looked at a video. I had no recourse but to walk away empty handed and out $25.

"I went to walmart to do a price match on gatorade from walmart.com\nI checked for the 18 pack but they didnt carry it so i went to papertowel aisle to see if they carried sparkle single roll they did so i remembered i had coupons in the car so i was heading to front with basket and i knew i was coming back in so near first few aisles i left the basket ran out to car to get coupons.as i was getting coupons i realized i left my yellow pouch in cart so i headed back in to where i left cart and the cart was moved i went to greeter sheila and asked if someone had turned in a yellow pouch sheila was very nice and courteous she told me she had given it to Gale at customer service i went to customer service where gina was and asked if someone turned in a yellow pouch she asked what it looked like i told her square with keys she then states she gave to tall white lady. I then explained to her that she gave my pouch away to someone else gina then stated oh well its nothin i van do about it she described it so i gave it to her very rude and nonchalant attitude i became upset thinking now that she gave away my pouch with my id money amex among other important cards with my name on them and she dont even act like she cares. I then asked if she was gonna call someone to help or at least attempt to see who she gave my pouch to she didnt even see if any info matched. She then called Gale who kinda tried to help i explained what happened told her how rude the rep was she asked me questions  and gina questions gina didnt even know what color clothing the lady had on she gave my pouch to all she knew was she was tall and white so then lost prevention was called to check footage i called the police since they stated was the only way for me to find out what was on footage. Police explained how she watched them take to customer service and then claimed it which i tried to tell gina that was probably how she caimed it even before the police told me that. I am very upset and disappointed and my issue is not resolved and i am highly not happy with walmart i feel something should be done i called corporate and was told someone would contact me in 3 to 5 business days which is crazy for something this sensitive should be rectified soon as possible. I will keep escalating this issue until someone takes it seriously your associate gave my pouch to the wrong person and i feel walmart should be held accountable","2016-09-19T01:15:54+0000","159616034235_10205243762892421","walmart",

"The 37th Street Walmart in Topeka, KS, has atrocious customer service.  I had a flat tire on a Sunday evening and I called just to see if the automotive area was open.  I was put on hold for 10 minutes and disconnected.  I called back and asked to speak to a manager.  After 15 more minutes on hold, I disconnected myself.  In the meantime, the tire was physically brought to the store only to be told that the auto section was closed.  I called a third time and demanded to speak to the store manager on duty.  I again waited (this time a mere five minutes) and my call was finally answered by Chris, who identified himself as both the automotive manager and the store manager on duty.  He apologised and seemed polite; I explained myself and asked to know what he would do to correct the situation.  He said he would look into the hold times.  He did not offer anything tangible to me, nor did I request it, as the original situation could not be resolved anyway.  But 25+ minutes on hold is unacceptable, and both your receptionist and store supervisors need education regarding the importance of answering calls in a timely manner.","2016-09-19T00:33:17+0000","159616034235_10154673221139236","walmart",

I told Jeremy to come check it out and when I pulled on the worm with a fork the other half just slid right out. You can even see the tunnel that half of it was still in.

"I want to share an amazing experience I had at the Walmart super center in St. Peter's mo off of Jumgerrmann rd today. I decided to go shopping at Walmart today for groceries. I went through the store and collected my items and went to check out. I got to the register and the cashier Tracy started to ring me up. When she was done my total came to 81.36 and I ran my debit card and it was declined. I tried again a few times and even ran it as credit and it was still declined. At this point my face was really red and Tracy asked if I had another form of payment to which I replied I didn't. I told her I just started working again and I got my first check on Friday and put it into my new bank account and all of the funds must not be available yet. I told her I'll have to put everything back and come back tomorrow if my funds are available. At that point Tracy walked around the cashiers stand and pulled her card out of her pocket and told me just come back to repay me when you can. I refused again and again and she insisted on doing it for me. I thanked her profusely and told her I would probably be back tomorrow once my money in my bank account is available. She said don't worry I'm here all of the time and you come back when you can. I walked out almost in tears. We always hear these type of good stories on social media and in the news these days but I never thought in a million years that I would be on the receiving end of those good deeds. I want to thank Tracy from the bottom of my heart. Walmart your cashier went above and beyond today with her customer service and she deserves recognition.

I take it to Walmart and present that release form to the rep at the photo center. GUESS WHAT! That wasn’t good enough.

"Yesterday in the middle of a garden project I discovered that my Walmart was out of my favorite compost ECO Scraps Compost.  So I started calling Walmarts in nearby cities.  When I finally called the store in Winslow AZ, an employee Walt (Walter)  quickly took my call and went to check the inventory.  He was back in a very short time with the report that he had 50 bags.  Wow.... ""I will be there as soon as I can"".  So I drove the 50+ miles to Winslow and there was Walt.  He had already moved the pallet into the warehouse walk space.  When I introduced myself, he remembered my name!!  double Wow!  Then he proceeded to help me load the 50 bags into my SUV.  \n\nThank you Walt (Walter) for being so helpful.

But what if, by chance, they are ready for pick-up very fast and I arrive after the seven days limit for pick up?

It works better to remove the entire cap to pour than using that ""spout"" that is on the cap.

My husband was told to wait several times as they got one manager, then a higher manager, so forth and so on. After an hour, still no resolution and no cake for my daughters bday. Its so exhausting and emotionally stressful when your child has picked a cake for her party and finds out it is not made. Also because of Walmart, our party was at a venue, and by the time we finally did get a cake, we had to rush the kids to eat it as our time was limited. Walmart put a major damper on my child's birthday. It is my duty to inform every consumer of the stupidity, lack of responsibility, compassion and professionalism Walmart is now become.

"First of all, there are some very rude workers at Walmart. I find it very aggravating that when you use a coupon you have to argue with the CSM at our Walmart as to why that coupon  is the correct one for the product then they tell me ""this says one per product"" so you can only use one. That is not true unless it says one per transaction or per household per day. I really feel that if someone is going to tell me how to use my coupons that they at least know themselves how to use them!!! There are also couponing classes that can help with this! Also, they should know that if it doesn't look like the picture you have to read the coupon to see if it excludes the product being purchased. We spend a lot of time buying, clipping, and organizing our coupons in an effort to save a few dollars! I don't see anyone questioning people about their food stamps that our tax dollars pay for and yet my coupons cost none of you a dime! 😡 Thank goodness that I don't have to shop here!

But before I could get some of the weights and weight bars, a sales associate whisked them away and put them under their register. Another associate two two of the large outdoor sprays and walked away with them I do believe they were not on break, and feel they should not be able to stash items away later for their purchase.

I am growing to hate Walmart. I rather spend more at Publix and Target and get treated like a human.","2016-09-17T20:58:44+0000","159616034235_10154669469549236","walmart",
"Your Oak St Brockton MA location is the absolute worst in the world. Customer service & management are awful as well. I went to the 20 or less line with 6 items & waited 10 minutes while the customer in front of me had over 60 items. As if that weren't bad enough, when they went to pay with their EBT card, the payment was not being accepted so I, along with the line of 10 people behind me stood for another 10 minutes (total of 20 mins at this point) while the cashier & non-English speaking customers slid their card a million more times. Why did the rest of us customers not move to another line you ask? Maybe because there were only 5 registers total open at the store with lines equally as long. I pointed out to the cashier that the customer had over 60 items & he laughed and said ""Maybe."" I didn't see the humor. Customers behind me also said the same thing to him, but received the same response. So as we all waited for him to call management, we requested that he suspend their order so the rest of us could pay for our LESS THAN 20 items & be on our merry way. He said he couldn't do that.  So at that point I had to choose to either stand in that line for another 10 minutes or switch lines & pray that that new line would move. (I found a new line & the cashier was nice & worked fast). While waiting, I called the store & asked to speak to a manager. The person who finally came on claiming to be a manager was awful. He did not seem to care that his staff wasn't doing their job correctly. I suggested that perhaps they should have opened another register (since there were about 8 unopened) for those of us who had been waiting in line rather than forcing us to go wait in a new long line. He didn't seem to care and was arguing with me. So with this, I'd like to say F*ck you Walmart & your Brockton location. I will NEVER spend another dime at your stores. I knew there was a reason to only shop at Target. \nYour Brockton MA location is dirty & has poor management. I'll never shop your stores again & I hope others will also soon see what a terrible company you are.","2016-09-17T20:18:35+0000","159616034235_10154669345924236","walmart",
"Purchased a 'whirl-a-motion' LED projector from Walmart in Liberty. Got it home and plugged it in and it doesn't work. My husband was getting ready to repack it in the box when I noticed a 'Return to Claim' slip taped to the back of the box, saying it had been previously returned because it does not work. Very annoyed that it was put back out to sell because someone didn't pay attention to the return slip taped to the outside of the box. I will be returning it, a second time, and hope it doesn't get put back out on the shelf.","2016-09-17T20:02:13+0000","159616034235_10154669291389236","walmart",

"Terrible experience with Walmart Pharmacy in Destin, Fl. Dropped off a written prescription yesterday, told the person I would be back to pick it up. 45 minutes later, after shopping, I checked on the prescription and they said it was still being worked on (though I observed two people in the pharmacy standing there talking and not working on prescriptions). I was polite, told them I'd be back today to get it then.\nSent my husband to pick it up thinking it should be no problem, he's told they have no idea what he's talking about an when he argued that he saw me drop it off, he was basically cut off and told they couldn't help him further. Oh, and also it was their lunchtime so if he wanted to stand there and wait until they got back then they could pursue it but they had to go to lunch. Are you kidding?! Who treats customers like that? It's great when you get the prescription discounts that Walmart gives but obviously it comes with a greater price. \nThe biggest thing is that basically I was lied to yesterday when I went to check on my prescription an told they were working on it when in all actuality they had done nothing. How many other customers are lied to on a daily basis?","2016-09-17T19:18:18+0000","159616034235_10154669187994236","walmart",

"I am in the process of returning a TV that I bought earlier today. Why? The TV was what I was looking for. It was posted on line at my local Wapakoneta, Ohio store for $328.00... I called the electronics department to see if it was in stock, the clerk said Yes. I called back with in 5 minutes because I found the Walmart was selling the exact same TV online for $298.00, the same clerk said thay I'd have to bring proof in the form of a print out, or a picture, and they would Comp the price. So I sent my son to pick it up, he had the picture on his phone. But, he forgot to show it at the time of the transaction. So I called again, this time I talked with the head register clerk or something, Ms. Cheyenne. My son drove the 10 miles back to the store, but Ms. C. couldn't find it on line, so no deal/ no refund of $30 plus tax. So I told my son, come get the TV and take it back for a full refund.

"Stopped into the store to pick up a few items.I went to the deli for some items before I left.  One man was working and two people were in back talking.  One was the manager of the deli.  When I got there only a mother and daughter were in sight.  It took  5 minutes to fill the order.  In the meantime nobody was called from the back to help.  When I finally got to order, this woman came from nowhere and claimed that she was next in line and that I had cut in in front of here.  The deli employee decided to side with her.  Really, I was there for 5 minutes and nobody was there at the deli counter.  So I told him that I could not wait any longer and that the store wasted 5 minutes of my time.  I asked him why did he not call someone out ot the back when he saw people  backing up.  He did not answer.  I told two other employees at the store about this and all I got from one check out girl was that sometimes these things happen.  I was in the Seneca Falls/Waterloo. NY store.

"On Saturday 8/27/2016 my wife and I bought some toys for our 2-year old daughter from the Walmart superstore on Hope Avenue in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was a plastic cylindrical container from Tub O’Toys that contained 9 “squeezable, teethable animal pals” for babies age 0+. When we got home I opened the container and let my daughter play with the toys. I initially took each individual toy to show to my daughter to teach her the name of each animal and did not notice anything unusual. Each toy has a small hole in its face that you can squeeze air through. I was playing with my daughter and squeezing air out of the hole in one of the toys to my daughter’s face when I noticed something shinny protruding from the toy she was playing it. I immediately took it from her and found a small hollow metal thing sticking out of the hole in the mouth of the light green frog. That metal thing must have popped out of the hole when my daughter was playing with it. I took it out and to my great shock it was half of a broken hypodermic needle with a large and sharp tip. This is extremely upsetting to us. I immediately took some photos and also sent a complaint to Walmart website (there is no function for uploading photos there) but have not heard back from them. What if I or my daughter got stuck with this needle? Who know whether it has contaminated with any disease! The number right below the bar code is 73554 06763 (don’t know if this is a lot number). How are you going to ensure this does not happen again to other children playing with toys from the same company? How are you going to rectify the situation? What is your corrective plan of action? As parents of course we take these things very seriously. As a physician, I am even more upset because of the knowledge that possible harm/disease could be transmitted to my daughter had I not taken the toy away from her. I hope you (Walmart) take this matter seriously and I demand a prompt explanation/answer from you.","2016-09-17T03:02:51+0000","159616034235_10154667048309236","walmart",

That metal thing must have popped out of the hole when my daughter was playing with it. I took it out and to my great shock it was half of a broken hypodermic needle with a large and sharp tip. This is extremely upsetting to us. I immediately took some photos and also sent a complaint to Walmart website (there is no function for uploading photos there) but have not heard back from them. What if I or my daughter got stuck with this needle? Who know whether it has contaminated with any disease! The number right below the bar code is 73554 06763 (don’t know if this is a lot number). How are you going to ensure this does not happen again to other children playing with toys from the same company? How are you going to rectify the situation? What is your corrective plan of action? As parents of course we take these things very seriously. As a physician, I am even more upset because of the knowledge that possible harm/disease could be transmitted to my daughter had I not taken the toy away from her. I hope you (Walmart) take this matter seriously and I demand a prompt explanation/answer from you.","2016-09-17T02:17:04+0000","159616034235_10154666977319236","walmart",

I then went to the service desk to ask for the manager in charge to make them aware of the matter. I spoke with a customer service manager who didn't  seem to care about a couple of working shopping carts for myself and another shopper who is paying money and attempted to contact another manager whom  never addressed the issue. I proceed to attempt to shop the store found product on self without price tags, and associates whom seem to busy to help me. This is by far  my worst shopping experience and the management team at this store is under performing and doing this retailer an extreme disservice.

"We have tried to contact Walmart so many times about our complained below but have been ignored by Walmart.\nOn Saturday 8/27/2016 my wife and I bought some toys for our 2-year old daughter from the Walmart superstore on Hope Avenue in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was a plastic cylindrical container from Tub O’Toys that contained 9 “squeezable, teethable animal pals” for babies age 0+. When we got home I opened the container and let my daughter play with the toys. I initially took each individual toy to show to my daughter to teach her the name of each animal and did not notice anything unusual. Each toy has a small hole in its face that you can squeeze air through. I was playing with my daughter and squeezing air out of the hole in one of the toys to my daughter’s face when I noticed something shinny protruding from the toy she was playing it. I immediately took it from her and found a small hollow metal thing sticking out of the hole in the mouth of the light green frog.

"I just got back from my local Walmart. I went there to put a tv my parents had see earlier in the day on layaway. The tv was the 55 inch roku tv on sale or at least the sign said it was $298. So I find a sale person and they take it to layaway for me. I get the layaway set up and they give me the receipt. I look at said receipt and realized that they were charging me $428. So I went back to the same person to get it fixed no big deal. To do this they had to have a manger approval. No big deal. After waiting about 20 minutes mins the manger finally shows up and is rude before any one had a chance to explain things. She looks at the sign says the sign is wrong and they will not honor the price. She then starts to walk off like that was it. I then said excuse mean but I would like to have the layaway canceled because the tv is $100 more then advertised. She then got really huffy and rude. This was the worst customer service I ever received in addition to the false advertising. At this point I will be writing a letter to their customer service as well as the BBB and at least one or two consumer watchdog groups.","2016-09-17T00:18:12+0000","159616034235_10154666811924236","walmart",

"Bought a Samsung 43 inch smart TV from Walmart in Dec 2015 in Live Oak Florida For $399 and bought the 3 year extended warranty for $36, The TV got a crack on the inside, called Samsung they said it was cover and someone would come out to fix it on Monday sat around the house waiting. No Show no phone call, around 6 P,M wife called was put on hold for over a hour. Finally got a hold of someone, lady on the other end said, they couldn't find anyone to fix it wife asked then why did you tell me someone would come out to fix it she said we will try to find someone. No call for days, then some one called and asked if she could send a picture so she did, then another call guy came out took a picture, repair man sated that the inside TV screen had flause in them any little bump and they would crack. said he would get back to us, no call back wife called hin he said Samsung would not fix it. So now I am without my over $400 and no TV, They need to bring back TVs that don't break or when you buy a 3 year warranty it should be covered.

"Stupid Walmart. First they wanted to charge me more for the same items on amazon. Then pay for shipping (which I don't with amazon). Then they say it will be here in 10 days (2 days with amazon). Next I try to cancel my order and I can't find it. I contact customer support and they have the wrong card and address (never heard of either). Then when we finally find it they say they might not be able to cancel it because they process ""so quickly"" and I might need to return it after it arrives. But I'll find out in TWO days if they canceled it. In two days I will receive my order from amazon.","2016-09-16T18:41:14+0000","159616034235_10154666008139236","walmart",

"Most people question off brands, but I have some things to say real quick about accidently putting one of your Equate brand products through a rigorous test.\n\nYesterday I washed my daughters purse and i guess I forgot to check all the pockets because as I pulled things out of the dryer, threw it all into a pile on my living room floor to sort out, and began digging through things I found a very hot but fully intact Equate brand pad. The gel inside was all clumped up but still plyable. The pad itself was not damaged in anyway, including the wings and the backside still having the paper on them which I peeled off and stuck it to my finger. Still worked! Picked it up off the ground having it stuck to just one finger! \n\nI know this isn't a real life scenario that women should be concerned with normally when picking products, but if you break the situation down and think about what it was able to with-stand with out ripping to shreds or loosing it's ability to remain adhesive, I think it's a pretty good indication of what this pad can with-stand in normal life. \n\nI've included pictures in the comments!","2016-09-16T16:25:57+0000","159616034235_10154665712024236","walmart",

"Walmart! I have an issue and I'm hoping to get some feedback and help. \nLast week we wanted to start out Christmas layaway and went to our local store. They didn't have several of the items we were looking for but the Walmart in another town did. I looked online but could not find anything that said whether or not we could make payments at another store. The only thing I found said that the last payment and pickup had to be done at the store the layaway was initiated...which makes it sound like payments could be done at any store. We called our local store and customer service told us that we could initiate layaway at one store but make payments at another. Great! So we went to another town and did the layaway. As they were ringing stuff up, my husband again brought up that we would be making payments at a different store and we were told ""That will be fine as long as the last payment and pickup is done here."" \n\nSo today we go to make our first payment at our local store and guess what...now we are being told that we can't do that and we must drive out of town to make each payment. We told her that we can't do that and that both stores told us it would be no problem and she shrugged and said ""Sorry. You can cancel but you'll have to pay a fee.""\n\nCome on. This is ridiculous.

"Oh I am upset! I have worked in customer service for 7 years out of my young career. Anything from grocery stores to minor league baseball teams. Tonight I experienced the worst customer service ever. This ""customer service manager"" in Walmart escorted my wife and I out because we got a bike down and sat on it. Didn't even ride the bike around! This lady followed us around and after we asked what was the matter she said in her radio ""no they are not drunk."" Just because my wife and I are young looking that doesn't give you the right to assume we are drunk and up to no good. My biggest issue with everything is the fact that she couldn't provide a response to why she was following us even after we asked!! Her explanation for that was: oh someone was talking in my earpiece. How about I am the customer and your are the CUSTOMER service manager. There is no reason to follow us around and supervise us like we are some criminals. Then when we finally got to talking to the assistant manager - he was just as incompetent and defended this lady. He told us we were a danger to kids riding the bikes!! At 11:30 at night??? Get out. He also told us he was allowed to follow anyone around the store he wanted. I don't know if that's true or not but having your customer service manager to be 2 feet behind us in the sharpie isle?? Ridiculous! \n\nHere's the issue: once you find out we aren't drunk and not causing problems she should be able to say okay I just wanted to make sure you weren't causing any trouble, have a good night! It's sad we live in a world where college kids have better customer service than 40 and 50 year old adults. I'm done with Walmart and their terrible customer service!

Yes, I understand it is the manufacturers fault but nobody and I mean nobody went even close to helping or sympathizing with my circumstances. Your motto is ""save money live better"" what a disappointment!","2016-09-16T02:29:27+0000","159616034235_10154500257562436","walmart",

"My daughter and I shopped at the Wal-Mart at Southlands yesterday.  We shop there often, and I will tell you that the friendliest cashier in the store is Bridgett.  She makes each customer feel like they have been her friend all their life!!  She treats everyone with kindness and respect..\nYesterday's experience was the furthest from that sort of feeling!!  Our checkout girl was Amie.  For reference, I want you to know that my daughter had gone and gotten us each a bag of Cheetos.  \nShe was checking out in front of me, so I heard the entire conversation.  \nShe asked Amie what the price was on the Cheetos and she checked the tape and said something like $2.78.  My daughter told her they were in 2 places on the shelf, one for $2.78, and the other for $2.50, so she had picked the packages from the $2.50 section.   Amie said, ""So?""\nMy daughter said she would like them for $2.50.  Amie said, ""What do you want me to do about it??""  My daughter said she would like a price correction.... Amie said ""No"".  \nMy daughter stated that they do price matching all the time..... Amie just stood there.  My daughter asked her to take them off her bill, she would purchase them elsewhere.  I handed her my package when it was my turn to check out.\nWe get home and my Safeway ad has them for $1.99!!\nWe would gladly have paid the $2.50 at Wal-Mart, but the attitude was totally unacceptable.\nWhat has happened to common decency?  All she needed to do was to call a manager over.","2016-09-16T02:21:21+0000","159616034235_10154664147554236","walmart",

"Can someone tell me why there is always just 1 serving of papaya in the $9.68 bag of Great Value Tropical Fruit #007874202251 that has strawberries, pineapple and mango, also? I have probably bought more than 30 bags and there is never more than 1 serving in most every bag. One bag out of 10 may possibly have an extra 2, 3, or 4 pieces, but never more than that. How can that happen every single time unless you are deliberately setting the machine to only put 1 serving in the bag? If you sold separate small bags of papaya like you do peaches, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, mango, etc. I would buy papaya that way. The only reason I continue to buy the mix is because I like to eat papaya occasionally. Thanks. Sheila","2016-09-16T00:31:37+0000","159616034235_10154663980549236","walmart",

"Hi Walmart\n\nAround a week since my complaint. Apparently you do not take customer service very seriously, somewhat seriously, or at all seriously. I redid your feedback through the ""proper"" channels, and have not heard a word from you. So I will continue boycotting your store. I will also continue encouraging others to do the same. Perhaps my story did not matter to you, but it did matter to my in-laws, who when visiting decided to go to Kroger instead after hearing about my experience. \n\nYou make good wings... when they aren't under cooked by a staff changed daily. Maybe you should consider apologizing to me at the very least.\n\nUntil then... do not shop at Wal-Mart. I won't. My wife and I will happily pay extra to be at Kroger or HEB. \n\nAll I wanted was chicken wings, I was there at the hours they were open, and your manager was rude to me for being upset that they closed early. Make this right.\n\nLike · Reply · Just now","2016-09-16T00:16:20+0000","159616034235_10154663935849236","walmart",

"I purchased a computer keyboard on the Walmart.com from DBROTH, the Marketplace seller.  The item said it was A UNIVERSAL keyboard, so I purchased it.  Once I received it, I found that it was incompatible with our Mac.  I contacted the seller and explained it did not work with some of my Mac programs.  They told me they will refund my purchase after I send back the keyboard.  I requested a return label with return shipping paid for by them but they refused.  I contacted Walmart, because, after all, the item is advertised as “universal” on the Walmart.com website.  Walmart did not acknowledge any responsibility.  I am very disappointed at the service because the shipping cost is almost the price of the item.  So I am stuck with a purchase I cannot use.

"To whom this may concern...\nI recently ordered tires through my  paypal aacount  on 8/24/2016 through walmart.com.  I called the Walmart near me to make sure that you had the tires I needed in stock.  You did. So I went to get the tires put on my car, but the manager Freddy said that I could not get my tires that day even though they were in stock. That i would have to wait two weeks to have them shipped then I could have them put on. I dont think he really wanted to help me. That was not an option for me because at the moment  I had two really bad tires. I needed them that day. So I had to pay cash for the tires in the store. Plus I bought  a new battery.  While I just spent $417.00 in your store for new tires and a battery, I am waiting on my car, and another manger approaches me named Shelly begins to accuse me of panhandling in her store in front of other customers and proceeds to have me removed from the store. Mind you im still waiting on my car to be fixed. I asked where did she hear that from. She said two other employees that were there informed her of that. Of course I asked who and she would not disclose that info to me.I was completely humiliated in front of several customers!!!! Then she finds out this is not true and never once apologized to me!!!!!!! On top of this I cancelled my order through paypal the same day. Here it is is 3 weeks later after 5 different times of contacting your  customer service department for my refund, and I still have not received my refund.  If you check your records. You will see I contacted you on  8/26, 8/31, 9/7,  and 9/13. I am a single mom and work 3 jobs to make ends meet. I have been shopping with you for 25 years THIS IS THE ABSOLUTELY MOST WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I  HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE. I WILL NEVER EVER BE BACK IN TO SHOP IN ANY OF YOUR STORES NOR WILL MY FAMILY. On top of this I keep getting an email that my tires are ready for pick up, so obviously your customer service never cancelled the order.  .So can someone who knows what they are doing figure out how I can get my freaking refund on my account!!  I am beyond pissed at this point and I am tired of contacting your customer service department .  I shouldn't have to pay for the same tires twice, and after what I have experienced in store and with your managers and the customer service department I should get a full refund on the money I spent in your store as well.

"Tried to use the pharmacy app today to refill my orders. Backserver error. Called the store # 1674 three times because they kept transferring me to the Pharmacy since your app and website do not list the pharmacy direct line. I was disconnected three times trying to get someone from the pharmacy to pick up the phone. I finally got someone on the phone. Everytime I go to the Pharmacy at this store the app doesn't tell them I need a refill and neither does the website. I also have to stand in enormous lines at this location all the time when arriving. It's difficult for disabled people to leave the house so you can imagine how difficult it is to be told that your medication is not filled yet because of a technical issue. I need help with adding my pharmaceuticals to automatic refill status and delivery so that I don't have to leave the house anymore to deal with this horrible process at this location and with your apps.","2016-09-15T20:49:04+0000","159616034235_10154663482629236","walmart",
"Worst online customer service I have ever encountered!

Both reps, Christine and Patricia, said there was nothing that could be done. I am outraged. That is. Or customer service. They didn't even try to help.

"At least one of the employees at your Camp Hill, PA location would benefit from extensive cultural awareness/sensitivity training. Or at the very least, training on how to differentiate what is and isn't appropriate to say to a customer. Today at 1:34pm I went to register #8 to check out my purchases (receipt ID # 7JZL2T21RN4R). The cashier was an older woman who, although she was very slow with the check out process, seemed the affable type. She spent a lot of time chatting up the customer ahead of me and fawning over the adorable baby she had with her. When my turn came she struck up a conversation with me, as well, commenting on my scrubs and inquiring whether I had just left work or if I was on my way in. During our interaction her eyes kept darting over to the couple behind me. The female was wearing a head scarf and a long gown, the male was in some sort of long, flowing gown as well and they were speaking a foreign language to each other as they loaded their purchases onto the conveyor belt. I felt vaguely uncomfortable at the way the cashier keep pointedly looking at them and then looking at me with a conspiratorial smirk on her face but I convinced myself that I was just imagining things. Imagine my surprise when she leaned in towards me while handing me the receipt and beckoned me closer. I leaned in at her behest and she whispered ""The woman behind you smells like camel piss."" I could not believe my ears. In my best mommy voice, the one I used on my son when he was a toddler and would something rude, I said ""Well. That was not a very nice thing to say.""  This woman did not even have the decency to look chagrined. Her response was ""I was just wondering if you smelled it, too. It smells really strong."" First of all, I didn't smell anything at all. And even if I did, I certainly wouldn't be able to differentiate the smell of camel piss from any other kind of piss because I don't spend my time sniffing and cataloging the different aromas of urine. I can only assume that this was her passive aggressive way of expressing displeasure at their egregious offense of looking and sounding different than her. To be honest, I've become pretty desensitized to racism these days. Every day I see acquaintances of mine posting comments on Facebook that range from mildly racist to flagrantly so, all in the name of ""politics"" and ""patriotism"".  Sometimes I see things that inflame my tender sensibilities, being that I'm a minority myself. But I keep my opinion to myself because everybody has a right to believe in what they want to believe in, right? If this cashier wants to believe that all people in foreign garb speaking a foreign language smell like camel piss, that's her business. But that this woman had the audacity to lean in and whisper this snide remark to a CUSTOMER like I was her BFF sharing some sort of inside joke with her was more than I could bear. I already complained to a supervisor at the store's customer service department who agreed that this cashier's comment was rude and ignorant and who stated she would handle this matter promptly. However, I am offended enough that I feel your corporate offices should know that this took place in one of your stores. I hope that at the very least this woman can get the training she sorely needs so that this may not happen again. Thank you.","2016-09-15T19:35:38+0000","159616034235_10154663225584236","walmart",

"I want to thank Mr. James Dick, Manager of the WalMart store on Albemarle Road in Charlotte, for his help a couple days ago.  I had locked my keys in my car and was waiting for my husband to bring another set of keys.  I had purchased several cold/frozen items, and I figured they would not tolerate the heat well!  Mr. Dick was outside the store near my car, and it appeared he was leaving for the day.  When he heard me tell someone about being locked out of my car, he immediately asked if I had cold items.  He said they could be stored in a refrigerator at the back of the store, and said he would be glad to take them for me.  When I commented that he must work there because he knows what to do, he told me he was the store manager!  He asked my name and pointed me to a bench inside at the front of the store; he took my cold things to the Customer Service desk where he gave them to a young woman! pointing me out to her.   Then he came to me, told me her name, and said to see her at the CS desk when I was ready to leave.  I did that, she got my things, and I was on my way.  Mr. James Dick is the customer-service-oriented kind of manager that EVERY store should have!","2016-09-15T16:40:42+0000","159616034235_10154662808859236","walmart",

"I heard recently, that in light of the FDA announcing that hand sanitizers do more harm than good, Walmart will be removing them from their shelves. There are so many things that Walmart carries that the FDA have said to cause harm, but yet there they are proudly displayed on shelves in the stores.  Cigarettes (and other tobacco products), Alcohol, E-cigs, candy, a lot of prepared meals, etc...  When will those be coming off the shelves?  Not?   Because they are money makers.  C'mon... really?  Not every one has time to run to wash their hands should they come in contact with some snotty nosed ( or worse) child or adult.  Imagine their cashiers having to deal with whatever germ or bacteria has been deposited on there lines and then that being passed on to your items and then brought to your home.  The only hand sanitizer that they said, a couple years ago, was truly not good was one with tri-something in it that made the use of antibiotic not as effective. Well at least other retailers aren't overreacting to this.","2016-09-15T11:01:29+0000","159616034235_10154661923584236","walmart",

"Let me start off with I LOVED Walmart up until tonight when I had the pleasure of buying expired yogurt and then only finding so out after I had drank a very small amount. That's when I realized I had literal mold and rotting milk in my mouth, which I immediately spit out. This is already a bad situation only made worse by being pregnant. As you can imagine ingesting molded products isn't great on its own but it'll be even more fun to expose my child too it as well. There is no excuse for having expired products on shelves let alone expired dairy products. This is unacceptable and I look forward to speaking with a store manager of not a district manager as well. You have lost a very loyal customer Walmart. Here's to hoping I don't get sick tonight! Thanks!","2016-09-15T05:07:20+0000","159616034235_10154661338099236","walmart",

"Walmart in essence is holding $800 of my money ransom! This is straight theft! I have a Walmart money that I loaded TODAY with my full paycheck. I went through a nightmare at the store with this card, and finally I was able to get into my account. After making three purchases - all which were basic purchases in legitimate businesses, I tried to make an online URGENT purchase and my card was declined. I called the customer service number on the back of the card and was transferred to an ""escalations"" department. The obviously foreign woman on the phone informed me that Walmart had put a BLOCK on my money and until I received my personalized card, I would not be able to access my money. My spouse, who has a very long history in customer service and support for corporations, handled this as I was at work. The female continuously refused to get a supervisor and told me I could no access MY MONEY because of the fact that there was suspicious activity. The block was lifted (this was in my email), but apparently someone blocked me AGAIN. When speaking the the foreign woman, she repeatedly refused to escalate my call. When I finally got put on hold, she came back on the phone to tell me that my card could have a temporary lift on the block for TWO MINUTES. Who can pay for medically necessary prescriptions, purchase incredibly important things online that are regarding bills,in TWO MINUTES? And this TWO MINUTES was only given to me because I refused to give up!!! I was also locked out of my online account, which means that even with my TWO MINUTES to hopefully transfer my funds I couldn't do so. I NEED MY MONEY. I AM BEING TOLD THAT WALMART WONT GIVE IT TO ME AND IT IS SEVEN DAYS BEFORE I CAN GET MY MONEY BACK????!!! THAT IS ROBBERY!!! REALLY??? I GAVE ALL OF MY INFO AND YOU STILL BLOCK ME??? Conveniently, the foreigner call was disconnected when I continuously DEMANDED a supervisor. When we called back, obviously we were MAD AT WALMART STEALING OUR MONEY AND ESCALATED. The EXTREMELY apathetic foreign man this time offered no option to get even a two minute lift, refused to put a supervisor on the phone, and when we progressively got more and more ESCALATED trying to GET OUR MONEY the man continued to refuse to escalate us and very flippantly told us that we could feel free to contact corporate but we wouldn't be looking at anything different in terms of getting the money. I am an insulin dependent diabetic who is in need of prescriptions, as well as my wife having LEGAL OBLIGATIONS that she needs to pay and now WALMART WON'T LET US HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT.

"Walmart.com is a horrible place to shop online. Now after two times I can say this is a place to shop cheap items(less than $ 50) and not for any thing costly. The customer care is again terrible .I am totally disappointed with the bad shopping experience at walmart.com consecutively two times which enforced me to write my latest experience here.\n\nOn Aug 30th 2016 , I ordered “Buchannan Microfiber Sofa” from walmart.com which cost me around $266.40 (including tax , shipping and handling) .I got an email from walmart.com that the order is placed successfully and it would be delivered by 14th Sept 2016. In my walmart account it also displayed a feedex number to track the order . But unfortunately whenever I tried to track my sofa, it took me to http://walmart.narvar.com/...., where it was mentioned that the order is just shipped. Since it was a heavy weight order , I thought they will update it as it delivers .Anyway, I was very excited to receive the new sofa today so as my family members were . \n\nWith excitement , I called the walmart customer care  to get the update on my sofa which is supposed to be delivered by Today and not yet delivered.  As per the request , I provided my order number to the customer care executive . I really got stunned with his answers . \n\nThe Walmart executive told me , there was a mistake from walmart.com and thats why the order is not yet placed .If I want, he would replace my order without any additional cost charged to me . It was very pathetic and frustrating to hear such kind of statement from the walmart executive. It has already 15 days gone when I placed my order and paid the amount  for the same , and after 15  days they are saying due to their mistake, they have not placed my order although a wrong information is displayed on my walmart account and me and my  family was counting the days and waiting for the day to come when we can get the new sofa.  Again most surprising thing is the customer care executive is saying , he can place a new order without any additional charges / penalty to me (such that I did anything wrong where as the mistake was from their side ) . Since I already waited for 15 days I requested them whether they can provide me a fast shipping so that I can get the sofa in less time (may be within a week) .But the customer care executive told me ,that it would take another 15 days if I place a new order now . I really got upset with the answer of the walmart executive since he told me if I want he can cancel my order within no time, I opted to do that. He cancelled my order and told the money will be refunded within next 5 -7 business days. \n\nThis is not the first time I experienced the bad shopping process and bad customer handling from walmart.com. I had few more experiences as well . But this time it really painful since I waited for 15 days and at the end faced such kind of things . Today I have decided not to order anything in future from walmart.com .","2016-09-14T22:53:02+0000","159616034235_10154660666794236","walmart",

"you employees are either grossly misinformed, or Walmart has the most ludicrous new ""policy"" that makes absolutely no logical sense.   Tonight at your Wapakoneta store in Ohio, and attempted to buy an alcoholic beverage, and was informed that they have to card every single person that appears to be with me, and if there is anyone below drinking age, or they have no ID, Im not permitted to  make my purchase, from a 12 year old boy, to my 28 year old daughter. Im not sure who came up with this ridiculous policy, but if this is in fact true, Meijer, and Amazon just inherited the $1000 or so a month I generally spend at your stores.  I would love for anyone to explain the logic of this to me, if I was buying for an underage person, and knew your policy, I would either not enter the checkout line with them, or leave them in the car, what's next? Video surveillance of every alcohol purchasing Cx from the moment they enter the store until purchase?  Will there be employees checking our vehicles before approving the sales?  Perhaps employees following us home, to watch us drink it. I'm sure whoever came up with this, was patting themselves on the back thinking they were making some sort of difference, to curb underage drinking, when in fact the only thing this policy does is fool the uninformed, and logically challenged into feeling better about themselves, (without comprehending it makes absolutely no difference at all, except to inconvenience your legal age  ""previous"" patrons.","2016-09-14T21:46:41+0000","159616034235_10154660515909236","walmart",

"I was very disappointed by the service of your online store. I'm not one to make a stink about a bad experience, but I felt I had to say something. I put an order online for delivery a week ago for some pillows and a mattress protector. I received ONE email confirming my order with two delivery dates. One shipment BY today and the other shipment BY tomorrow. I returned home today to see I didn't receive anything. I looked at my email and tracked my order and it hasn't even shipped yet, it's still processing. When I finally got through to a representative on the phone, it sounded like there was a party going on. I couldn't hear anything he was saying and his service kept breaking up. He informed me that my order was stuck in processing and it would have to be resubmitted. He offered me 1-2 business day shipping, which was sweet, but at the rate this experience is going, I'd be lucky to get my items in two weeks after it's done ""processing"".  I'm moving tomorrow evening and these items were much needed. I decided to cancel my order and go elsewhere.","2016-09-14T21:08:28+0000","159616034235_10154660418234236","walmart",

Attention citizens of NLR, Arkansas and patrons of The Walmart Supercenter on McCain in NLR....Very disappointed that one of their employees and manager working tonight 9/13/16 at 9:15 pm would deny entry to a Disabled Veteran and her service dog. My friend even showed paperwork and ID card and was still denied entry. Even after they were told that is illegal!!!! Shame on them!!!! Just a few days ago their entire store and staff were paying respect for 9/11 what hypocrites they are!!!!! Disrespectful, distasteful and degrading to those who serve our country!!!! How funny they allow entry to barefoot, half dressed individuals, drugged out, drunk, criminals and many other walks of life, but you denied entry to someone who just wanted to buy groceries at a time of night that is better for her to not be crowded and have a chance for a PTSD episode with her dog there to deter such event from happening, again SHAME ON THEM!!!! #Walmart #NorthLittleRock #DisabledVeteran #KATV #KARK #KTHV #Fox16 #ServiceDogsMatter  #CNNNEWS #CNN #HeadlineNews #FoxNews #NancyGrace #PTSD #VeteranLivesMatter #DisabledLivesMatter PLEASE SHARE!!!!!","2016-09-14T12:46:22+0000","159616034235_10154659175109236","walmart",

"I always thought big companies such as Walmart would be a supporter of kids in school.  I went in trying to get donations for a bullying club my girls are involved in.  We are putting together a positive turn to what these students have been through and supporting our troops.  We are putting together care packages to send over seas.  I went in to ask and all I get is there has been no budget for donations since February. And being the only shopping place here other then the grocery stores.  Again more money for the upper management.  SMH :'(  Another reason I try not to shop here anymore.","2016-09-14T05:52:07+0000","159616034235_10154658384769236","walmart",

"Very disappointed that your employee and manager working tonight 9/13/16 at 9:15 pm at North Little Rock Supercenter on McCain would deny entry to a Disabled Veteran and her service dog. My friend even showed paperwork and ID card and you still denied her entry. Even after you were told that is illegal!!!! Shame on you!!! Just a few days ago your entire store and staff were paying respect for 9/11 what hypocrites you are!!!!! Disrespectful, distasteful and degrading to those who serve our country!!!! How funny you allow entry to barefoot, half dressed individuals, drugged out, drunk, criminals and many other walks of life, but you denied entry to someone who just wanted to buy groceries at a time of night that is better for her to not be crowded and have a chance for a PTSD episode with her dog there to deter such event from happening, again.

"I bought a better homes and gardens comforter yesterday and found an object sewn into it called manufacturer but did not return my calls until later today. I took back comforter to the chiefland fl walmart where i bought it and explained the situation to them that there is an object about the size of a 50 cent piece and about 4 inches long and everytime you try to feel what it is it breaks into smaller pieces. Well it had me worried what it was because made in china. I asked them to cut it open to see what it was and they refused. We argued a little and i got my money back. Well manufacturer called me back about it and i told them what i had done and they asked why did they not cut it open to see what it was. I told them manager said it wasnt his job along with other employees. What kind of a place is walmart running when they dont care about the welfare of there customers. I hope with all of the crazy things going on in this world there was nothing harmful to me or my son in that. Seems like big box store might care a little more.

"I have an idea on Walmart gift cards. Since I'm part of a church organization that has a stand against alcohol and tobacco - i'm approached by people in the community to help with food for a needy family. I would love to be able to pre purchase some food only gift cards that i could give them and then they as a family could go to Walmart and purchase their food. I don't have to worry about buy alcohol, tobacco or other non food items because the card is only for food.  I think government food stamps card works the same. Anyway i thought i'd pass it along. I know in my community this would be of great assistance and many pastor friends, like me, would love to have this option.","2016-09-13T20:24:39+0000","159616034235_10154657184944236","walmart",

"Sir, I am writing to you about the new add that is on TV, about how you and Walmart care about the people that take care of the customers \nthat goes to Walmart.\nI am here to tell that you do not take care of your employees. I was working for Walmart on August, 2015, where the building filled with CO2. If I had not demanded that the par medics be called because of chest pains and short breath, then we would have all been dead. While in the hospital I had visits from an asst. manager, once, two visits from a dist. Manager, and four visits from the store manager. My family was called several times from an asst. manager the morning that this happened.\nI was in the hospital for two days and then sent home. During my time at home, I did not get a card, flowers, potted plant, or phone call from anyone from the store or the home office. I was off work for two months. When I did return to work the asst. manager said it was ok to use an electric card to get around because I could barely walk. Around the time that this asst. manager transferred, the store manager then informed me that without a dr. note I could no longer use the electric card. I got a note from my doctor and was informed that it was not good enough but it had to be from the home office.\nI send the papers in myself because I was still getting bills that I had given to the store manager to send in to worker comp. Upon checking after about three weeks later, I found out the a manual chair had been approved along with a stool at my reg. I went in to the store to see why this had not been done because both the store manager and the personal manager had gotten not one email but two of them. \nI did settle the workers comp. case with a small amount of money. However when I applied for unemployment, It was turned down for the simple reason the under oath both an asst. manager and the store manager stated that I could have still worked for Walmart. At the time of the settlement with workers comp., I called the home office and asked if I could keep my discount card because of the CO2 and the things that happen after and was told no because I had not been with the company 15 years, however, I had been with the company for 11 years and 9 months.\nThe store was being remodeled, however, the permit for the remodel was never posted anywhere in the store. As there was gas powered saws being used inside of the store without open ventilation, and the contractor has never admitted fault for any of this. Also I would like to point out that there were never any monitors for CO2 put up before this happened.\n\nWalmart Hi Nancy - Thank you for sharing your experience with us. Please contact our insurance carrier Claims Management, Inc. at 1-800-527-0566 so we can assist you properly.\n.\n\nI called that phone number and after a week I was given another phone number however it was disconnected. So is it your feelings that we will just give a person disconnected phone numbers until they goaway.","2016-09-13T19:01:12+0000","159616034235_10154656926839236","walmart",
"Well, I already lodged a complaint with Walmart which was absolutely no use. I stated that the last time I was there, I was accosted while leaving the store because my receipt was buried in one of the bags and I was not allowed to leave until there was proof that I bought the items even though all were bagged and I just came from the register. Well, I went back again today. I had a pleasant conversation with one of the cashiers I have known for the past 20 years. I spent $205. As I was leaving, this time with receipt in hand, that wasn't enough. She wanted to go through my items and check them against the receipt. All items bagged except for the dog food. I was really livid and walked away from the girl. I told her that I just walked away from the register and if she felt I stole something she could call the police. I just walked out and put the items in my car. A manager came out of the store and watched me the whole time. If that wasn't humiliating, I don't know what is. I then went to Kroger and purchased $100 of groceries. I left the store without being harassed by anyone. I will now be shopping at Target, Kmart, Dollar tree and other grocery stores in town. I refuse to be treated with disrespect and made to feel like a criminal.","2016-09-13T18:59:29+0000","159616034235_10154656914834236","walmart",

"ordered tv  over 2 weeks ago..i understand shipping is not always direct route but why would it go from Ohio to upstate eastern NY ,i assume via route 80,as you can see it got there last week,which is 200 miles from me in Harrisburg pa which is central pa.,now a week later it's back heading west, north of Pittsburgh,.. 120 miles from me..basically you moved it 80 miles in a week ..its at a warehouse you passed within 2 miles on the way to Albany.I ordered it on aug. 29...Someone at walmart needs to look at a map here is tracking from my order page ...Tracking for Order #5131638-954224\nLocation Date Local Time Status\nWoodland, PA 09/13/16 09:07 Arrival Scan\nSharon Springs, NY 09/08/16 23:01 Departure Scan\nSharon Springs, NY 09/08/16 14:58 Arrival Scan.........Look,just as the crow flies just from the pa. ohio border it traveled 625 miles,probably 1,000 by road..as you can see from that point at the pa. ohio border it is 189 miles to my house.Seems very inefficient to me.the red dot is clearfield, pa. warehouse (where it is now).my tv has been loaded and unloaded off of a truck and bounced around on conveyor belts a minimum of 4 times since it left it's original warehouse in ohio and it's still not here..think it might be damaged or will break in less than a year because of all of this banging around..NEVER will i buy from Walmart again.same tv was $10 more on Amazon..would have been worth it ..it would have been here in 5 days.i tried to post 2 google maps as proof but it will not let me.","2016-09-13T18:54:10+0000","159616034235_10154656903164236","walmart",

"Speaking as a person who watches every penny we spend I am also a couponer. The fact that your stores do not accept competitor coupons for things (example: 1.00 off two of xyz item) causes me and many others like me to stay away from your stores and go to other grocery stores that do accept competitor coupons. There are several in this Sunday's paper that I was hoping to honor in my local store since it is in fact 1 stop shopping, however, I will make the extra 20 minute drive to save myself some money at bi-lo since they do accept the competitor coupons. You people at the top who don't have to watch your pennies on a daily basis need to spend some time with the ""little guy"" and see how john q public lives. There are several others who feel the same way I do but don't take the time to make comments, they just stop shopping in your stores all together. Sales from competitors don't last forever so if you truly want to keep customers in your stores then you need to start matching deals and coupons better, so you loose a little on one or two items for a week or two, you have MANY other items in your stores to compensate for the loss.","2016-09-13T18:21:30+0000","159616034235_10154656847299236","walmart",

"Timeline.\nSep 13, 2016 10:56am\nI purchased two items from Walmart.com advertisement Reg. $744.99 on sale for $549. After months of research & price comparing I purchased from Walmart this ad because of the sale price and security & peace of mind of the name ""Walmart"" since it was for a very expensive investment. I only received one of the two items listed on my paid purchased receipt! After spending hours & multiple days working with the not so helpful Help Desk, waiting for 24-48 hours for manager to call back & never receiving one. All I get when calling back is ""it's unfortunate"" me & my family have to just deal with the inconveniences & additional expenses this false, miss leading advertisement sale has caused us. I have been offered a refund and that is all suppose to be okay! It does not matter, I purchase and paid for two items offered because I NEED them both! Now my money is tied up & Walmart does not care what financial nor physical damages they have caused my family! I am blown away at Walmart's help desk, corporate reps, customer service & blame game. I am in disbelief we have waited on our Walmart order shipment time, then time trying to get order issues resolved, now will have to wait on return shipping & refund time. Walmart could careless, they just post any detailed item description with model numbers & then say ""its unfortunate"" that's what it says you ordered but that's not what we meant to sell you!!! It was actually a third party contractor & that was not suppose to be the two items we advertised and sold you!... I've been told so many contradicting stores, reasons and excuses I'm just kicked to the curb!

"Sir, I am writing to you about the new add that is on TV, about how you and Walmart care about the people that take care of the customers \nthat goes to Walmart.\nI am here to tell that you do not take care of your employees. I was working for Walmart on August, 2015, where the building filled with CO2. If I had not demanded that the par medics be called because of chest pains and short breath, then we would have all been dead. While in the hospital I had visits from an asst. manager, once, two visits from a dist. Manager, and four visits from the store manager. My family was called several times from an asst. manager the morning that this happened.\nI was in the hospital for two days and then sent home. During my time at home, I did not get a card, flowers, potted plant, or phone call from anyone from the store or the home office. I was off work for two months. When I did return to work the asst. manager said it was ok to use an electric card to get around because I could barely walk. Around the time that this asst. manager transferred, the store manager then informed me that without a dr. note I could no longer use the electric card. I got a note from my doctor and was informed that it was not good enough but it had to be from the home office.\nI send the papers in myself because I was still getting bills that I had given to the store manager to send in to worker comp. Upon checking after about three weeks later, I found out the a manual chair had been approved along with a stool at my reg. I went in to the store to see why this had not been done because both the store manager and the personal manager had gotten not one email but two of them. \nI did settle the workers comp. case with a small amount of money. However when I applied for unemployment, It was turned down for the simple reason the under oath both an asst. manager and the store manager stated that I could have still worked for Walmart. At the time of the settlement with workers comp., I called the home office and asked if I could keep my discount card because of the CO2 and the things that happen after and was told no because I had not been with the company 15 years, however, I had been with the company for 11 years and 9 months.\nThe store was being remodeled, however, the permit for the remodel was never posted anywhere in the store. As there was gas powered saws being used inside of the store without open ventilation, and the contractor has never admitted fault for any of this. Also I would like to point out that there were never any monitors for CO2 put up before this happened.Comments\n \nWalmart Hi Nancy - Thank you for sharing your experience with us.

"I am so very disgusted with Walmart.  I ordered a 17' Skywalker trampoline for my sons birthday on July 28. I received an order verification email, with a comfirmation number, and a scheduled date of delivery; being August 4th. \nIssue #1: That date came and went....no trampoline. I tried being patient. On Monday the 8th, I called Walmart, only to be told I had never ordered a trampoline. After a 45 minute conversation, the lady finally informed me, Walmart had made a mistake. The trampoline I ordered was not available any longer. A courtesy email from Walmart explaining that would have been nice---anyway....I was told I'd have to order another one & she would rush it to me, free of charge. Which did happen. Thankfully. \nSO- my second issue is: I received an email stating I would be receiving a 17' x 15' oval skywalker trampoline on August 15. I never ordered, nor needed a second trampoline. I have no idea where it even came from, yet I was charged for it; using the same card I had purchased the original trampoline with. Once the second trampoline arrived, I refused shipment before it was ever taken off the UPS truck. Wayfair emailed me immediately, indicating their warehouse had been notified of the shipment refusal, and as soon as the packages were received, they would notify Walmart to issue a refund. I waited patiently...for seven days. No refund. \nIssue #3:  I called Wayfair to be sure they had received the package. They had, and had also notified Walmart. I called Walmart, only to be given the go-around. ""We see no order number for that trampoline"" ""You have to call Wayfair, there is nothing we can do."" I called wayfair again, and was told they had done all they could do, since I paid Wal-Mart, they were (obviously) unable to issue a refund, I must call Walmart. So I did. After speaking with a customer service representative for another 45 minutes, I was finally told they could see where Wayfair received had received the trampoline and I would be refunded within 3 - 5 business days. So I waited.......no refund. This has happened for the past three weeks. Call Wal-Mart, told I'd be refunded in 3-5 business days, wait patiently, only to NOT be refunded. We're now going on week FOUR. I do not understand what the hold up is, quite honestly, at this point-- I don't care. Wal-Mart was quick to charge my account. ($426.99, TWICE!!! Which may not be a lot of money to some. But it is to me.) This is a mistake one of your employees made and it is WAY beyond time to refund me. I will not call Walmart again, if instructed to do so. I've wasted too much of my time calling and being lied to already.  I have done nothing wrong, other than order a gift for my sons birthday. I just got off the phone with your corporate office. This time I was told the refund would be issued in SEVEN days. I am still waiting...Not so patiently anymore. Absolutely ridiculous.","2016-09-13T14:25:34+0000","159616034235_10154656243579236","walmart",

"I tried to send my feedback via email but the Walmart website doesn't provide a way for me to do that so I'll just post.  I just called to check the status of the rug I ordered from Walmart because it says it's still processing online. Walmart tells me I have to call Overstock since the order came from them. Overstock informs me that Walmart had a system issue where 1000s of orders got stuck in the ""Processing"" status, they have to cancel them all and they don't recommend you reorder them from Walmart because they don't have a fix. I have to reorder from Overstock where it's $20 more. I went against my better judgement shopping at Walmart.

"Walmart SUCKS!!!! Our daughter, single mother of 2 babies on fixed income, brought her car in for an oil change. The oil filter fell off in less than 2000 miles. The engine is blown. Because she is on a fixed income, she does not drive it unless absolutely necessary. The oil change was in March. They immediately denied the claim stating that it was not their fault. I heave been changing oil in vehicles (thousands) for over 40 years and NEVER had one fall off. Walmart acknowledged the filter WAS THEIRS (they have the tech sign it) and that THEY DID DO the last oil change. Do you think they would do the right thing and own up to their screw-up?? Nope, now our daughter is without a car and no means to replace it. Does WALMART even care? Nope, they did not even acknowledge it once the claim was rejected. CLAIM #7871748 Jeremy Rasmussen was the POS who denied the claim. THANKS AGAIN BIG BAD WALMART for BEATING DOWN THE LITTLE PEOPLE FOR YOUR CORPORATE MARGIN!!!!\n\nIt gets better.  Walmart has decided to do nothing so we decided to try and start the car.  When we went to put the filter on, it would not stay on.  They put the wrong freakin filter on.  THIS IS GROSS NEGLIGENCE!!!  They still refuse to take responsibility.  The writing on the filter is THEIRS and they acknowledge it is their tech.","2016-09-13T10:48:37+0000","159616034235_10154655699164236","walmart",

"my last two trips to the walmart in north brunswick nj 08902 were awful. I ordered photo gifts. the first time a one hr order had me waiting in store for 45 minutes after the order was supposed to be filled. i even called ahead of time. next time again before a party i ordered a gift but the site said they would need 4 hours to fulfill. i called to find out why. waited on hold for 15 minutes so i called back. again put on hold for 20 minutes to be told no one in photo center i should call back in an hour. i decided not to risk it and just order regular prints. i was emailed to say prints were ready. i went to the store to pick up and it was a disgrace. no one was at the center. i found an employee and requested help. she said she would send some one. 10 minute later and a line forming i found her again and said no one came. i explained my wife and baby were in the car and i was late for a party. she assured me it would be handled. all i needed was my pictures to be rung up. after another 10 minutes i asked for a manager. she went and found manager who told her to tell some one from electric to come assist. he refused because he was busy. i called the store twice and asked to send manager and she never bothered coming. after 40 minutes the guy from the computer area came and rang us up. at first he said to go to another department to ring us up. i told him i wouldnt leave and wait on another line. he finally rang me up. #walmartepicfail #walmarttreatspeoplehorribly","2016-09-13T08:19:56+0000","159616034235_10154655445339236","walmart",
"Okay #walmart I'm going to start by saying that September is childhood cancer awareness month. I realize if you have not been directly effected by this horrible disease, that by the way is the number one cause of death in children, you probably didn't know that. Most people don't.\nI was in a local #walmart  in Berryville Arkansas yesterday and there was an entire display of pink tshirts supporting breast cancer awareness yet nowhere in the store is a mention of going gold in September. We need to bring awareness to the fact that our children are being diagnosed and dying everyday from cancer! People don't think that kids get cancer but they do and it sucks. Ask any parent who has watched their child suffer through it. It is hard to bring awareness when you can't buy even a simple gold ribbon in most stores. It is overshadowed by all of the pink that is already covering store shelves everywhere. I wish  #walmart would show their support by stocking their shelves with merchandise that's sales go to fund research that might someday save a child's life. As the mother of an angel who will forever be 3 years old because of this disease I would love to walk in to #walmart to find a display that supports Going Gold for Childhood Cancer Awareness!","2016-09-13T06:14:52+0000","159616034235_10154655191274236","walmart",
