"Ok so our sweeper quit today went and bought a ""new"" one at Walmart well we came home watched a movie then I decided to open it and sweep the floor got the handle put on then noticed it had already been used.it had hair and dirt in the filter and the container the latest collects the dirt. We paid full price for something that had obviously be returned. So called walmart lady was rude and said bring it back with receipt and could get a new one. Who's to say the next one won't be the same. It was sealed and everything like a brand new one would be. I don't mind buying a return at a discounted price not brand new price. End of rant.\nso ???? is this a new walmart policy to sell used items at  new price","2016-09-26T00:37:02+0000","127217884039924_1195644680530567","Walmart100",

"Just left here with a load of stuff, but I had some broken eggs checking out today and not the cashier or the customer service desk associate would help me. I have 2 very small children with me. The cashier just said she couldn't help because they were a biohazard now. I went ahead and paid for them and went to the customer service desk. The associate there said, ""you will have to go back and get more eggs, or I can return them."" I told her I needed eggs and she just shrugged her shoulders at me 😟 After 10yrs with Walmart at Store #1 i was so surprised that no one offered to have someone get the eggs for me. The cashier even noted how I had my hands full. My daughter had been holding a new Elsa doll to be purchased and in the egg confusion I forgot to have the cashier to ring it up. So I had the customer service desk associate ring it up. She gladly did that, but just looked at me with me eggs. Now I'm home with 11 eggs and a mess in the carton. I tried to call the manager on duty when I got to the parking lot, not to necessarily complain or get something done, but just to bring some awareness to how associates need to take note of each customers needs. I was told all managers were in a meeting and I needed to call back later.\n\nOn a positive note! I LOVE the Memorial Day flag displays. It makes the store look so nice. I love how it represents MY Walmart! Proud Walmart shopper, but this experience was just difficult for me today.

"I go to this store almost daily. In the last 2 months I've went to the customer service desk twice. Once to return an item...with my receipt....and they were rude and refused. They said it was against policy to return items after 2 wks...new policy. I knew that was a lie and went to another walmart to be able to return my item. Then a few days ago, I went to the customer service desk to pay for a dvd because all the lanes were backed up and the girls at the service desk we just standing around talking. When I asked to pay for the dvd the girl rolled her eyes and glanced over at the lanes and sighed loudly as if it was a huge problem to help a customer as she bagged my dvd and tossed it onto the counter. I then told her she could keep the dvd and I would again go to another store. I work in Bentonville accross from the home office and live in Gentry so it's convenient to go to store 100. But I've gotten to where I'd much rather just go to rogers or even pass through Gentry and go to Siloam just because of how rude all the employees are at 100.

"Waiting in the garden center with 2 items to check out and the cashier is hunched over the register on her phone. I have photos but I am unable to post them. There was a huge line of people and 1 self checkout down, 3 occupied, and the other register was full as well. Someone had to holler and waive her down for help because her nose was in her phone. I absolutely understand checking a text message but to not greet customers or even interact with them at all rubs me the wrong way. Especially being right across the road from the home office where the CEO could walk in at any given moment. Take pride in your job, people. You're lucky to have one.

"I can't believe that I can not look at the wal-mart website and find out how much a case of water is priced. I went to the website looking to price a 24count case of 16.9 oz bottled water. A friend is picking up water for me and I wanted to find the lowest price! Nope they tell me how much a pallet of water is and it can be shipped and the 35 count of nestle water is not sold in my area for that would be great it is on sale. What I sense is that Walmart is changing to bulk sales and no wonder us single people go to publix for they treat you better and even with the prices higher it is better then having to use your phone to navigate and find things is easier. I went to get a hydrometer and not one person knew what it was let alone it was supposed to be in the garden section according to the website. Yeah it was in the DIY area!!

"Dear Wal-Mart I would like you to know your store manager Jill Richey has told her associates to ban all semi trucks from the store lot in N. Vernon IN. When I mentioned I would like to buy a few items I was told I would have to go elsewhere. Really your management team really needs to stop discrimination against truckers. I could fully understand if I was trashing your parking lot or damaging something but I was simply taking a rest break and going to purchase things needed from your store. But after I was so rudely told I can't park here because all truckers are not wanted here was discrimination by the drivers that deliver your freight and purchase items to keep your stores running. SHAME ON YOU WALMART FOR LETTING THINGS GET SO BAD YOU HAVE TO DISCRIMINATE ON ONE GROUP OF SOCIETIES WORKERS = COMMERCIAL TRUCKERS. CAN YOU FIX THIS? ARE YOU WILLING TO FIX THIS. BECAUSE I EVEN SHOWED THEM THE RESPONSE YIU SENT ME AND THEY SAID THEY STILL DIDN'T CARE.  PLEASE CONTACT ME ON HERE AND I WILL PM YOU MY # I TRIED TO CALL YOUR 1800# AND JUST GOT THE RUN AROUND. \nTHE STORE IM REFERENCE TO ID #1158 ON IN-3 IN N VERNON,IN.

"Everyone in the town (Bowie, Texas) knows sweet, hard working Jackie from produce at Wal Mart. He always had a smile and a kind word for the customers. After 10 or 11 years employment with the company he came into work 30 minutes early like usual and was jumped on because the bananas were not stocked and instructed to go outside and get the carts, Jackie said okay, just let him clock in which requires a manager over ride since he was not scheduled till 1:00 and employees must be on the clock to work by company policy. The manager told him he didn't need to worry about clocking in, just get out there and do it. There was much more verbal abuse but, there is not space here to write it. If this had been the first time a manager at the store had bullied him it would be bad enough but, several times managers have bullied this young man, in my opinion, simply because they know they could get away with it. A manager at the store (who shall remain nameless, in order to protect their job) told me they had seen him bullied more than once by other employees. This is not the store Sam Walton envisioned, this is a disgrace to his memory. Jackie was so upset and tired of being bullied over the years that the next morning after more than 10 years he quit. SHAME ON WAL MART !\nI myself remember an assistant manager named Claudia that was transferred to another store since, yelling at him for responding to a customers hello, with a smile and a hi. She informed him it was not his place to talk to customers and he better tend to produce and keep his mouth shut. Wal Mart likes to make a big deal how they hire the challenged yet, they treated this more than 10 year dedicated employee like dirt.","2015-07-16T19:24:28+0000","127217884039924_933372590091112","Walmart100",

I went to slef check out and had 8 things in my arms well i dropped a bottle of vasoline and a dvd and it fell onto the scanner the vasoline scanned and i heard a ding from the dvd thinking it scanned then seconds later the maxhinr says the scale isnt working . I pay for my items and walk out the door to be greeted at the door by the walmart security very rudly making me go to his office right in front of atleast 20 people the whole time me not knowing what was going on . Got in the the back room and he was telling me i stole the dvd . Threatening to call the cops if i didnt present my drivers license right then. I tried explaining how i heard the dvd scan and how the machine said it was not working properly and he was still very rude and treating me like a theif telling me he is being very lienant on me he is usually worse on other shoplifters. I asked several times to see the video of where i intentionally stole the dvd and asked for him to check the machine that was malfunctioned and he refused . I was also explaining if i was to steal a dvd i would of ben a more exoensive one instead of one that was only $5!!!!!! he took copies of my license and sent me on my way saying i was very lucky .. so how am i lucky?? after being treated like a theif and threatened over and over about going to jail and calling the cops .. and saying ill be under further investigation and he wipl be looking into video survailance to see how many other times ive done it . If he finds out im lying ill have a warrant issued for my arrest !!!! i demand an apology!!! sooo very disapointed and not to mention my wife was with me and she was ever more humiliated !!","2015-04-26T03:36:39+0000","127217884039924_891206360974402","Walmart100",

"I HAVE A PROBLEM, THAT IS GETTING BIGGER ALL THE TIME;  I WROTE THE LOCAL WALMART TO LET THEM KNOW THAT IT IS BECOMING IMPOSSIBLE TO SHOP THERE, BECAUSE WE CAN NEVER FIND AN ELECTRIC CART, AS I AM UNABLE TO WALK ANY DISTANCE AT ALL.     I GOT A REPLY SAYING THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT;  AND I ALSO REPORTED THAT A FRIEND WENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND FOUND THE EMPLOYEES RACING THE CARTS---UNACCEPTABLE, WHEN THEY DON'T RUN WELL NOW.    THE COUPLE OF NEW ONES THEY GOT A FEW MONTHS AGO ARE RUNNING LIKE THE OLD ONES.   TODAY I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION I DON'T LIKE HAVING TO MAKE;  THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I HAVE TO GO HOME, BECAUSE I CANNOT FIND A CART, AND HOME IS 13 MILES AWAY.   BACK TO MY DECISION.\nI MY HUSBAND WENT HUNTING FOR A CART AND BROUGHT IT TO ME;  HE SAID TO SIT ON THE FRONT EDGE AND PUSH BACK AND FORTH TO GET IT TO GO;   THAT IS WHAT I DID---YES, IT MOVED, A FEW FEET, AND SOMETIMES PART OF A ISLE'S LENGTH, THEN IT WOULD STOP.   I WOULD ROCK SOME MORE, AND GET IT GOING, TILL I COULDN'T STAND THE PAIN IN MY BACK;  I QUIT SHOPPING AND WENT TO A LOCAL STORE IN THE SMALL TOWN NEAR OUR HOUSE TO FINISH.  THERE I SPENT ANOTHER 40.00.   THE PAIN WAS SO BAD I COULD HARDLY WAIT TO GET HOME AND INTO BED!   I AM STILL HURTING VERY BADLY, AND IF I WERE A DISHONEST PERSON, I WOULD GO TO THE E.R. AND BILL YOU GUYS!   BUT I AM NOT LIKE THAT.    I WILL INFORM YOU THAT I WILL NOT SHOP AT WALMART IN PITTSBURG, KANSAS UNTIL I HEAR THAT THINGS ARE BETTER, THEY HAVE MORE CARTS AND I DON'T HAVE TO ROCK THEM TO KEEP THEM GOING.   I WILL GO NEXT DOOR TO DILLION'S, WHERE THEY HAVE PLENTY OF CARTS AND THEY ARE IN GOOD SHAPE.    I AM DISABLED, AND SO ARE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE,  SO IN CASE YOU ARE NOT AWARE, DISABLED PEOPLE ARE USUALLY PEOPLE IN PAIN, AND/OR HAVE NO STRENGTH TO GET AROUND,  THEY USUALLY ARE UNDER DOCTOR'S CARE AND UNDUE STRESS ON THE BODY COULD PUT US IN DANGER.   I BROKE MY BACK AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP ME;   I HAVE A VERY PAINFUL PROBLEM WHEN IT GETS STRESSED, LIKE TODAY, IT FEELS LIKE THE BROKEN BONE IS COMING THROUGH MY SKIN!   SO MY DECISION HAS NOT BEEN EASY, I HAVE NOT REALLY SERIOUSLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT TILL TODAY---BUT THE PAIN IS MUCH TOO MUCH!    I HOPE YOU FIX YOUR CART PROBLEMS SOON IN PITTSBURG, KANSAS.       BY THE WAY, I HAVE BEEN IN WALMART STORES IN OTHER PLACES IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THEY HAVE NO CART SHORTAGE, AND THEIR CARTS RUN SMOOTHLY AND NOT ROUGH AT ALL, AND ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO SIT JUST RIGHT TO MAKE THEM WORK.    ALSO, AN 81 YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO IS A PRECIOUS GREETER IS ALLOWED TO PUSH THESE CARTS WHEN THEY GO DOWN.    SHE IS AN ASSET TO THE STORE, WHY SUCH TREATMENT TO SUCH AN ACCOMMODATING LADY?","2014-09-19T22:57:57+0000","127217884039924_750708335024206","Walmart100",

"Last night,3/15/2004 my sister & 92 yr old mom were driving west on Interstate 66 headed towards Gainesville,Va.Several miles before 234 Prince William Parkway, my sister moved into a left lane,an 18 wheeler immediately followed. He bore down on her, blew his horn, never braked. I was driving in the far right lane,& was terrified thinking he was going to hit them and kill them both. There was less than a car length between them when my sister accelerated .When I passed him to see who it was, and blew the horn at him, he fell back and moved back into the next right lane.The Speed limit is 65 mph in that section. It was a Walmart 18 wheeler.I was so distraught, did not get his tag number, only a # 53 on the truck behind the cab. This was reckless endangerment! I am going to file a complaint not only with Walmart but with VDOT and DOT. Walmart can find this driver- It was 9:08. Trucks have devices that check speed. You have records of trucks,and their routes. My brother drives an 18 wheeler, I am aware of the trials and tribulations of truckers- and of safety concerns. My family owns a construction company and has big rigs. They DO NOT drive in this manner. First I was horrified and frightened, now I am livid. At the very least, he needs to be re-trained. Perhaps given anger management training as well as re-certification with DOT.

"Good morning, yesterday I went to your Walmart store at 2500 W 95th St Chicago, to pick up tickets (I had already purchased Online via Ticketmaster) for the Alvin Ailey Dance performance, and the Associate didn't know how to operate the Ticketmaster machine and directed me to Customer Service in the front of the store to pick up my tickets, but when I went and stood in line for 10 minutes, I was told to go back to Electronics for the tickets.  I asked to speak to the Manager, who simply directed me to go back to Electronics for the tickets, I regretted purchasing (Ref # 406600602246) the groceries that I picked up, and left this store with incompetent employees.  I went to the Walmart store on 85th/Stewart, and picked up my tickets in less than 5 minutes by a knowledgeable and competent employee.  This type of behavior needs to be investigated and corrected to remain at the top of the corporate ladder.","2014-03-08T17:40:47+0000","127217884039924_649553235139717","Walmart100",
"After many MANY attempts to get STORE CREDIT for a defective product, the Walmart in Panama City Beach FL on Front beach drive has given me NO response and has not followed up with me at all.  EVERY single asst. manager gave me the cold shoulder and was very rude and quick to say that I would have to suck up the loss or contact the company making the product.  I have the original receipt and have already lost 3 months of use.  In addition, I was told the manager would call me and he/she has not touched base as of yet.

"Today I was reminded of why I NEVER shop at Wal mart! I needed packaging tape and a few other items and Wal-Mart (at Exit 7) seemed to be the easiest stop for me and Hayden. After getting our items, Hayden wanted to look at the fish before we left. I noticed a man dressed in jeans, blue hoody and a baseball cap looking at hand sanitizer for over five minutes. I was already creeped out by him when a woman and her three young girls walked up. The man hid behind the aisle and was watching them from around the corner. As a mom, my instinct was to warn this woman and her children. As I walked by them I told her there was a man watching her and I kept going. He CHASED after me and my son. I was terrified. I went to the amunition aisle thinking that someone might help protect us against this lunatic chasing us. He approached me and said yelling ""if you just told that women I was watching her you messed up! I am security"" I told him he doesn't look like security he was just creepy! If he would have just told me before she walked up that he was with security and monitoring a possible shop lifter I would have understood. Long story short, as a consumer at Wal-Mart I felt threatened for my safety by one of their own employees and their managers didn't seem to care very much or understand my concern. I will NEVER go back!","2014-02-15T23:51:02+0000","127217884039924_639639252797782","Walmart100",

"hope everyone is having a great weekend. Ive had a plan through STRAIGHT TALK  for my cell phone from walmart now for years. I bought an extended protection plan for a new phone this past summer. customer service for STRAIGHT TALK is very poor. it took talking to 3 customer service representatives before I could get one I could understand. the first two spoke broken and non understandable english. they sent me a corrupt email for instructions on how to return the broken cell phone and when I tried to get them to resend the info they gave me a hard time and kept me on the phone on hold then just to have me repeat ALL the info I gave the first rep I talked too. I still havent recieved a readable email from them. I sent them a response stating a just wanted a refund for the phone since they were not being helpful in replacing the damage one. PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT STRAIGHT TALKS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE AS A CELL PHONE CARRIER.  this is not the first time ive had difficulty with them, just the last time. if anyone know of any websites I can air my complaints against STRAIGHT TALK please let me know. the more people I can make aware of their poor service, the more people I can stop from buying their products and experiencing the trouble and headaches I have been through.","2014-02-02T02:44:23+0000","127217884039924_632444383517269","Walmart100",

"Dear Wal Mart Corporate Offices,\nI ran to Wal Mart this morning as I forgot some things when I went last night. I ran through the store, that you so conveniently rearrange every week as to entice customers to purchase more items, and hurriedly retrieved my items in ten minutes. I reach the checkout lines and of course there are only two open:   A twenty item or less line with 10 people in it and a regular line with two customers. I choose the latter as their buggies didn’t seem that full.  \nBig mistake, it seems the woman at the front of the line was a comper.  Definition a person who spends hours of their time searching though advertisements and online looking for lower prices at every store in the free world and clipping thousands of coupons.  You in your infinite wisdom have set a new policy to make it harder on these thrifty shoppers trying to save money for their families by requiring them to bring in all of these advertisements with them.   \nNow let me clarify one thing, when I was at your establishment yesterday I got behind yet another comper with two irritable children.  Probably because their attention span of the long trip had given out.  I do not nor have I ever had the patience for the process of comping prices, I forget coupons in my car or at home.  I applaud those of you that do and know that you save your families a ton of money.  However, those of us who have run in on our lunch break, have somewhere important to get to, or just have no patience for this process, implores Wal Mart to designate a checkout line for this process only.  \nI understand families on a tight budget and do not wish for this process to be banned for them, but my time is more important to me than any amount of money this process saves me.  The 24 hours of my life I have spent waiting on this process could have been spent at work, with my family, just enjoying the day.  So, before someone goes postal in one of your two open checkout lanes, please address this issue.  Also, to you compers, after holding the line up with you wad of advertisements and 500 coupons, could you at least turn around to the 20 people now standing in line waiting on you and apologize for our time you have waisted.  Again I applaud your efforts, but when your efforts inconvenience others a little common courtesy is do.\nThank you,\nShane Sliger\n","2013-12-21T15:16:52+0000","127217884039924_607696872658687","Walmart100",

"Dear Walmart Store 100 Design Layout Team,\n\nIt is December.  Back during the summer when you removed the Millstone coffee bean display, I thought I'd be okay-however cold weather is upon us.  I am in desperate need of at least 2 pounds of whole bean peppermint coffee.  I appreciate the syrup from Starbucks but it just doesn't taste as good.

"I was told that the district manager is from this store for Heber Springs. I have a question. You advertise a sale for last night one at 6 and one at 8. I was in the store before 7 for the 8pm sale for the tv. They were all gone why is this. Did not say come in at 6 for a wrist band. If a sale starts at 8 why give the items away at 6, if your giving out wrist bands why not for all the other items as well. I just feel this is false advertisement for a sale that starts at 8 but its all gone by 6. We spoke with the store manager he said to contact Bentonville store for the district manager. I hope that someone can respond back to this","2013-11-29T14:23:13+0000","127217884039924_597778356983872","Walmart100",

"Walmart and Walmart.com should be ashamed of themselves! I purchased several items on Walmart.com yesterday evening and was sent an email early this morning stating they were cancelling my order due to a ""technical error"" on their website. While I understand these ""errors"" do occur, I don't believe your loyal consumers should pay the price. As far as we knew we were just getting in on a ""great deal"". The fact that a company as dominating and prosperous as Walmart can not own up to their own error and honor the prices displayed for their consumers is absurd. Your attempt at to smooth over the cancelling of our orders, in the form of a $10 e-giftcard is insulting to say the least. I am a longtime Walmart consumer and do the majority of my Christmas shopping at your stores or at Walmart.com. The fact that you have cancelled my order and still have that transaction pending in my checking account leaves a bad taste in my mouth! If you cancelled the order than you should have cancelled the withdraw of the funds as well. I sincerely hope that Walmart takes a long hard look at the mass amount of disgruntled consumers and makes right what they made wrong!","2013-11-07T07:43:35+0000","127217884039924_585945588167149","Walmart100",

"I would really appreciate some confirmation & consistency at the Walmart stores considering price matching.  For example, today I had an ad for Cottonelle toilet paper 12 double roll= 24 rolls for 4.99.  The ad had ""Ultra"" handwritten instead if printed block letters.  They wouldn't honor the ad unless it was specific.  Went back to the toilet paper section & that toilet paper is no longer stocked.  You know why?  Because the blocked letter ""Ultra"" has replaced it.  Even the Cottonelle website no longer has it listed in handwritten ""Ultra.""\n\nDon't misunderstand me, I'm grateful for the opportunity to save money, I would just like ALL the Walmart stores to be on the same page regarding the price matching policy.  I don't believe Mr. Sam Walton intended this to be so difficult for the customers, the cashiers, or the managers.  Spending too much time being too knit-picky so to speak.  Less productivity, less money.  Although I Read that Walmart's total net sales last year was $419 billion.\n\nSo Really?  May we please have some consistent guidelines throughout.  I love Walmart, I shop there every day or practically every day as I do the shopping for my elderly parents as well as for myself and my disabled husband.\n\nSincerely,\nA very loyal customer","2013-07-26T01:42:27+0000","127217884039924_492010350894007","Walmart100",

"Dear Decision Making Executives:\n\nAs I sit here composing this letter I’m racking my brain to figure out how I will function without your company. Having learned that you will no longer carry Paula Deen’s products when they run out in your stores has me seriously concerned. \n\nBorn and raised in Georgia, in the 50’s & 60’s and even into the 70’s the “n” word was common. I personally do not use it and taught my children not to use it because it was hurtful to others. With that said, I taught them many other words not to use because they were just as hurtful. Feelings are feelings and they are not defined by color, gender, religious choice, etc.\n\nMy struggle comes with you helping to destroy a woman for a choice of wording made years ago, out of extreme emotion. Seriously. What if someone came forward and said that Sam Walton had used this word? (NOT in any way implying he did.). How would you want the American people, and the numerous companies you do business with, to react? \n\nPaula is not guilty of a crime, only of not being “Politically Correct” before the term was even in existence. As you pose to throw your stone, ask yourselves, “Are we without sin?” Do you have cd's, books or movies in your stores that have the SAME word in them? And you make a profit of those products. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, I am one person. But one person whose family has spent a large portion of their income in your stores. I can only hope that you will reconsider your decision.\n\nSincerely, Brooke Campbell","2013-06-28T17:12:05+0000","127217884039924_478756015552774","Walmart100",

"Dear Walmart; \n\nI see from your corporate posting that you're severing of ties with Paula Deen-branded products based on something that she said thirty years ago. So I have to wonder; Will you also be pulling music CDs that have the N-word in their lyrics and how about the ""Django Unchained"" movie DVDs which have the N-word uttered 119 times during the course of the movie. Gonna pull that off of the shelves as well? \n\nDo you honestly expect us to think old Sam Walton never uttered the N word in his lifetime? Come on Walmart. Don't succumb to the court of public opinion. Do right by Ms Deen, she's made you folks one heck of a lot of money. Dissing her now is foolish and short-sighted, and calls into question your very integrity.  \n\nI know in all likelihood you won't bother to answer me, but I'd really like to know what you're gonna do about all those music cd's & movie dvd's with the dreaded ""N"" word in them? You can't have it both ways. It's a matter of integrity, and ethics. \n\nLori Lamb ","2013-06-27T07:40:52+0000","127217884039924_478069265621449","Walmart100",

"I have completely stopped shopping at Walmart.  I have written at least 10 letters to Walmart and CEO Mike Duke. I have sent receipts showing at least $500 over a 8 mo period.  First I tried contacting the store mgr. (East York PA) I never got an answer and every time I called they said he was in meetings.  Anyway, I went in took pictures of the sale prices on items and what was actually charged, for ex:  White American cheese, sale price 2.97lb, they charged me $4.99lb and argued and said the sale was over they forgot that sign, Then I spent days going through ads and coupons.  They wouldn't take half the ads because the store name wasn't on them? The commercial says no store name needed.  Then I just started collecting receipts and I can't even get the CEO to acknowledge me, I am on a fixed income and struggle to make ends meet.  Walmart does not care about its customers or its employees, the management makes more in one day than its employees do in a whole  year....So now I am at the point where I guess I am out the money because I have sent them receipts and called and No Answer at all.

"Walmart is the largest private employer in the U.S. — and has the most workers on public assistance. In 2007, the company shifted from regular shifts to flexible shifts, a change labor activists said was designed to force full-time workers to downgrade their status to part-time, so they would not qualify for health insurance or other benefits. The result is that hundreds of thousands of Walmart employees rely on state benefits or Medicaid. Most of the company's warehouses are contracted out to temp agencies, so even if a warehouse loader works full-time in a Walmart warehouse for years, he gets no benefits. Walmart has also spent at least $1 billion since 2005 settling lawsuits over unpaid wages or illegal working conditions. One study estimated that Walmart workers cost taxpayers more than $1 billion every year. ~ The Week 2/2/13","2013-02-04T11:42:53+0000","127217884039924_409218275839882","Walmart100",

"A OUTRA FACE DA WAL MART BRASIL\n\nBoa noite sou associado da Wal Mart Brasil trabalho em uma de suas unidades no Rio Grande do Sul ( Brasil ), uma empresa que diz ter um código de ética mais não é cumprido passei por uma situação muito desmotivadora esses últimos vinte dias na empresa a empresa é só no papel na pratica é totalmente diferente trabalho na unidade de Bento Gonçalves ( NACIONAL ) atualmente ocupo o cargo de vendedor na empresa já tive promoção aprovada por dois gerentes de loja e no momento de marcar minhas avaliações sofri retaliação por parte do Capital Humano tentei usar a política de portas abertas da empresa depois de vários emails enviados aí a empresa soube usar a política dizendo que minha promoção não tinha sido aprovada por diferença de salário sendo que não foi por este motivo chequei a ir em Porto Alegre para entender melhor o que aconteceu pois mesmo assim continuaram a me enrolar passando os dias continuei enviando emails até que o Gerente de Capital Humano entrou em contato em uma Call aonde usou novamente a política da empresa para se defender aonde eu levantei uma série de dúvidas sobre a política da empresa entre outros pontos que minha promoção não foi aprovada por outro motivo usaram muito bem a política da empresa pois a Wal Mart diz ser uma empresa que zela por seus associados que tem como um de seus princípios básicos o respeito pelo individuo não é a primeira vez que acontece esse tipo de situação comigo na empresa já tive minha conta de Email excluída várias vezes por ter entrado em contato com o comité de ética da empresa  inclusive agora excluíram definitivamente meu Email para não poder mais entrar em contato com ninguém para que não se espalhe o acontecido as pessoas que deveriam nos auxiliar nesse tipo de situação são as mesmas que fazem retaliação o mesmo acontece com muitos associados a empresa ao invés de motivar faz ao contrário até o associado a baixar a cabeça e pedir demissão aí o problema está resolvido, tive varias trocas de Email até excluírem minha conta mais ninguém tomou uma atitude é um desrespeito por parte da empresa usar a política dessa forma pois uma associada da ética entrou em contato comigo e em algum ponto mencionou que o relatório que foi enviado  pelo capital humano dizia que eu tinha recusado a promoção pessoas com cargos importante agirem de tal forma meus colegas tem a mesma opinião que a minha mais não a mesma coragem que tive a empresa não tem nenhum respeito pelo individuo todos os dias tem associados pedindo demissão desmotivado por tantas coisas erradas até mesmos encarregados pedindo demissão e a empresa não toma nenhuma atitude apenas justifica os erros e desculpas isso é apenas um terço do que realmente é a Wal Mart Brasil.","2013-01-12T12:13:00+0000","127217884039924_393906450704398","Walmart100",

"My wife and I were doing some last minute Christmas shopping at the Bentonville Walmart when my iPhone must have slipped out of my cart. I frantically searched for it but it was nowhere to be found. I went to customer service and a very conscientious Walmart employee named Ethan had already found it and was turning it in. I had an enormous amount of information on that iPhone not to mention the expense of having to replace it had Ethan not been so diligent in finding it and honest and efficient by promptly turning it in to Customer service. My wife advised me that anything she had ever lost at Walmart had always been turned in for her to retrieve it in customer service. Thanks Walmart and thanks Ethan for your honesty and integrity. I didn't know where to call or write so I hope this note gets to the right individuals who can properly acknowledge Ethan for representing Walmart in such a positive light.

"hi . as reported  by many news agencies . on black friday thousands of walmart workers across the country will walkout on strike!!! for those who would ask why let me give you a few of the facts. between 2001 and 2006 walmart cost our country 133000 manufacturing jobs . for every walmart super center in a community 750,000 dollars is taking out of local economy. for every store in the walmart chain it cost tax payers 420,000 dollars because 70 percent of walmart associates are receiving some sort of public assistance. workers are not asking for alot they just want a living wage . meaning they want to be paid enough so they don't need to depend on tax payers. they want to be respected as people and not treated like dogs . I used to work for walmart and i liked my job. but because i told fellow associates they needed to stand together if they didn't like the way they wer treated .I was forced out of the store . A manager made some very inappropriate  comments about my 15 year old daughter. i went to the store manager and to the market manager and they both seemed to think it was ok. so i quit.  these are the kinds of things walmart believes in. so for those of you who are planning on doing some or all of your shopping on black friday I do apologize.  we the associates of walmart want only to be respected as hard working people. our intent is not to hurt the community  but to send a message to the bully of Bentonville.","2012-11-07T05:03:05+0000","127217884039924_365245053570538","Walmart100",

"Unfair Labor Practice Strike Defined:\n\nEmployees who strike to protest an unfair labor practice committed by their employer are called unfair labor practice strikers. They cannot be discharged or permanently replaced. When the strike ends, unfair labor practice strikers, absent serious misconduct on their part, are entitled to have their jobs back even if employees hired to do their work must be discharged. An economic striker can become an unfair labor practice striker during the course of an economic strike if the employer commits an unfair labor practice, such as failing to bargain in good faith.","2012-10-26T03:16:33+0000","127217884039924_360486297379747","Walmart100",

"This is relating to the Athens Wal-Mart Supercenter Store #661.\nI went to customer service on 10/18/2012 to get a price match done and customer service there was horrible. First to start with the employee Vickie said they cannot do the price match because your competitor price was not a sale price. So she said Wal-Mart does not price match item unless it is on sale. Meaning the item at the local competitor has to be on sale to price match it, that it could not be that other stores regular price. So I asked to speak to the manager and Brandon came to speak to me. While I was speaking to him Vickie and another employee at customer service named Jennifer kept on interrupting the manager and I and kept bringing up ways not to price match the item. When the manager finally agree to price match it Jennifer came in and said that I had to have the item now so she can scan the serial number. When I told her the serial is on the receipt then she said well the item (phone) will deactivate. I kept on telling her that it I bought it without a contract but they kept on trying to find ways to not refund the difference to me. When the manager give the authorization to refund the money, Vickie butted in again and saying in a sarcastic tone to the manager that if she goes to the dollar general and buy things for a dollar she can bring up everything to walmart and have them price match it. Then the manager changed his mind and saying I need to have the local competitors ad. I clearly had walmart price match policy pulled up on my phone and showing him that it said I did not have to bring in the ad. Then he was indirectly telling me I should bring back the phone and returned it completely. Vickie and Jennifer was talking to me as if I was an ignorant foreigner and because I am of middle easten decent and have a little beard that they could speak to me with any tone they felt like. Vickie said she been working walmart 20 years now and she never refunded a price match unless the other item was a sale price. When I asked for the district or regional manager name Vickie said she did not know it. So I said you been working here 20 years and didn't know your regional or district managers name. I don't know what kind of of employee does not know there managers name. I will be filing this case with the better business bureau and the state of Alabama. In this modern time in a first world country I would not think people still discriminate about color or religion anymore.\n","2012-10-18T05:10:55+0000","127217884039924_357498401011870","Walmart100",

"Hi Wal-Mart, I just wanted to let you know that a few members of your night crew at the store in Magnolia, AR seriously need an attitude adjustment. I think it is extremely rude and inappropriate for the employees to act like a customer is bothering them by simply walking up to the register. This is not a one time occurrence, sadly, it feels like this has gotten to be the norm. Regardless of how many or how few customers are in the store, I don't think its too much to expect a little common courtesy. Seriously, this kind of treatment of customers can't be good for business.","2012-09-06T03:21:57+0000","127217884039924_342033979224979","Walmart100",

"Posted for Darlene A Bourgeois McKinzie from West Monroe, Louisiana...\nI had to make a trip to my local Walmart here in West Monroe, LA today. My trip was not going well. I went there to try & exchange a binder I bought my child for school three days ago. The zipper had already torn up on it. Customer Service said there was nothing they could do because my child’s name was on the binder. My child’s only in the 3rd grade, so yes his name is going to be on it. When I buy something, I do not expect it to mess up within three days. Well that was not acceptable to me. I could understand if it was maybe mid school year or something, but its three days! So I told them I want to speak to a manager. A manager came & we pretty much had the same discussion. I told her, look my husband has brain cancer & we travel too Houston to MD Anderson every Friday for treatment. (Which is a 6 hr drive for us.) I CAN NOT just waste money on buying yet another binder. Every penny matters right now to my family. She still told me there was nothing she could do for me. That since my child’s name was on it, Walmart would not get credit for it when they send it back. This really infuriated me. \nI went found another binder, thinking I was just going to be out more money. Then I decided that was not the end of it. I then found a Walmart employee, and ask them to call over another higher up store Manager. I told that Manager “Allen” what happened. He said so you are just trying to exchange it, not get your money back. I said yes. He said don’t even worry about it. We are going to get this fixed. The name on it doesn’t even matter if you’re just exchanging it. I’m like that’s all I’m trying to do is get my child a binder that’s not broke for school, nothing more. So it took it to customer service & told them to fix it. They did not like it at all! They were making all kinda rude comments. \nMy days are difficult enough dealing with my husband’s stage 4 brain cancer, I do not need any more stress added to it by someone being a jerk and that’s what the people at customer service were doing. I don’t believe part of their job description is give people a hard time. Thank you Allen for coming to the rescue!!!\n\nSome people would have said it was not worth it, but to my family it does. That money that I did not have to spend again will go toward my husbands treatment!\n\nA HUGE THANK YOU to Allen a Manager at West Monroe, LA \n— with Jòseph ß McKenzie.\n","2012-08-26T00:21:10+0000","127217884039924_338018886293155","Walmart100",

"The problem that I have is waiting for 2 hours to get a simple oil change at your Batesville, Arkansas store.  I understand that there is a process and I was willing to wait.  I even told a female manager my concerns.  It was on the saturday over Fathers day weekend.  The store was only working 1 or maybe 2 workers in the tire and lube express shop.  They all told me that it was because the Corporate had ordered all stores to cut employee hours.  When I called 1-800-wal-mart they took my phone number and said they would call me back.  Several days later I recieved a call from the store pn Ash Flat (Wrong store returned call)  Their manager said there was plenty of workers at their tire and lube express that day.  Which leads me to believe that mayne this problem is unique to the Batesville store only.  After speaking with several wal mart employees, they say that their store is cutting hours so the managers monthly bonus will be bigger....
